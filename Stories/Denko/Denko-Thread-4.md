##OP  
I’m being tested by this girl I’m dating…  
How’s a guy supposed to react to this kind of thing? Tell me, somebody… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
…Denko guy? Is that you?  
  
##OP  
Yes. Sorry I’m late with my report. (´･ω･`)  

I was successful in coming into contact with Denko on Friday, but a bunch of other things happened… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
yoU… AGAIN…  
  
##OP  
First, I paid Denko’s friend 20,000 yen to make sure my plan went smoothly.  
I asked her to request Denko to go buy alcohol.  
And then finally, finally I saw Denko again! (´･ω･`)  

I didn’t want to suddenly call her, so to display my passion as her boyfriend, I snuck up from behind and hugged her… (´･ω･`)  
  
##OP  
Denko’s body felt so warm… (´･ω･`)  
It might have just been the best moment of my life. I don’t think I’m going to wash these clothes, so I don’t forget.  
Denko was surprised too, and let out a really loud shriek and ran, but I wasn’t going to have that again!  

I grabbed her arm so she couldn’t run. Because I wanted to hear her true feelings… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
I’ve seen scenes like this in horror films about serial killers…  
  
##OP  
Denko was really hollering, so her friends got worried.  
And she said she was going home for the day. And they all told me not to come near Denko again… (´･ω･`)  
  
I HOPE SHE REPLIES SOON (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
Have you asked her how she felt after that?  
  
##OP  
Well, I’d rather have advice on how to do that than do something clumsy…  
That’s why I made a thread, so I could ask you guys… (´･ω･`)  
  
##OP  
Denko, you’ve been so much trouble to deal with… I’m exhausted.  
I want to talk it out with her, but I need help on how I should go about it… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
Dear god, this guy is even more of a crazy than I thought.  
  
###2ch  
Poor, poor Denko…  
  
###2ch  
Are you still emailing her pretending to be her friend?  
  
###2ch  
Seriously, still not behind bars?  
  
###2ch  
Hey…  
I’m the Snake from the last thread, but, uh…  
How did this happen…? I was hoping I could be reassured it was just a troll…  
When did the flower-viewing start…? When was OP in Yoyogi Park…?  
  
###2ch  
^ How long were you there?  
  
###2ch  
^ From around 3 to 4:30. I couldn’t stay that long.  
Two other Snakes who were there since 12 told me they didn’t see anybody like the OP.  
The guests were starting to leave, so we left too. Uh, at least I got home safe…  
  
  
[[And the thread dies without any more OP posts. But then…|Denko Thread 5]]
