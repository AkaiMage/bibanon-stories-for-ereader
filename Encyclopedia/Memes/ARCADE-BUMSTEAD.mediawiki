A character named [[Arcueid Brunestud]]. In a "Goofus and Gallant" parody (wrong and right) in [[4chan]] [[/w/]], the wallpaper page. One of Goofus's wallpapers was a picture of her with the words: "YO DIS B ARCADE BUMSTEAD FROM [[TSUKIHIMAY]] I'D HIT IT."

A further bastardization of Arcueid Brunestud, from [[Porkslope Turkeyhandle]]. The original topic was first stickied and then locked; the moderator who did this claimed that the thread was "Pure [[/b/]]", and it had been locked to prevent other [[/b/tards]] from tainting it. Variants of it are commonly used by /b/tards as wildcard images.

Porkslope Turkeyhandle is a bastardization of [[Shingetsutan Tsukihime]]. Other Tsukihime characters have seen their name bastardized, such as Yumizuka Satsuki (Sadchan Yummysucka).
