## Gay Furry Son ##

Sup /b/
I come here with a question, about my own son. He'll be 16 in August, and me and my wife are very worried about him...
He's gay, and he has an online relationship with a 20-year-old in Virginia, and he's very open about it...it makes me quite ashamed that I have a gay son, and to make it worse, he's into some fandom called "furry" and I've seen pictures of it...it's vile and disgusting.
Me and my wife don't know what to do. We've punished him numerous times, but he won't give it up. We've taken assorted things from him such as a dog collar he insists on wearing and even an animal dildo. (Jesus Christ)
What should I do, /b/?
