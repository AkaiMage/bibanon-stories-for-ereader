##OP
I was going out with my girlfriend Denko, but she suddenly told me we’re not dating… (´･ω･`)
Does this mean we’ve broken up?

###2ch
They…
They haven’t arrested you yet?

###2ch
You’re STILL here?

Forget about Denko. I feel so bad for her.

##OP
Hey, this is no laughing matter!
I made this thread so I could sort things out inside before I went to meet Denko today.

This is how things went:
I confessed -> Denko gave me the okay -> Denko said don’t email her -> Denko wasn’t dating me to begin with
I guess? I don’t understand it at all… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Show us that supposed “okay” email. In full, no editing.

##OP
Me: “I love you, please go out with me!” (Abbreviated)
Denko: “Sure” (Non-abbreviated)

##OP
She suddenly changed her phone number and email address, so now I can’t contact her, as much as I want to…
Plus there are strange rumors spreading about me at school, and everyone’s ignoring me… (´･ω･`)
It hurts so much…

###2ch
gg, man.

But it could still be worse.
On top of changing her phone number and email to get away from you, she could have you checked into a mental institution.

##OP
Please! This is a huge shock to me!
I can’t believe Denko would do something like this…
Because just yesterday, one of Denko’s school friends sold me her new email and phone number for 60,000 yen… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Same guy, huh… Frankly, I’m amazed he’s still around.

###2ch
Wait a sec.
I saw the old threads, but OP, did you really send over 600 emails without getting a reply?

##OP
I didn’t have any experience with romance, so yes, I sent that many.
But I’m better now that everyone’s warned against me doing that… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
That’s dedication, man.

But what would you do if Denko liked someone else?

##OP
I don’t think that would happen, but if she got another boyfriend, I’d cry… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
She doesn’t want your love, so pretending to date Denko is just troubling her.
It’s a waste of time getting so attached.

##OP
If I got another girlfriend, what would I tell Denko?
What would be the point of that?

###2ch
Haha, this is funny…
I just woke up my girlfriend who was sleeping beside me, had her read the previous threads… and now she can’t sleep anymore.

###2ch
Given the title of the thread, don’t you already know it’s time to give up?

###2ch
^ Let’s be realistic here, he didn’t have a girlfriend at any point.

###2ch
So, did you end up getting a reply from Denko?

##OP
After I sent that message, Denko changed her number and address, and the next day her friend sold them to me.
Then I tried sending another email, but she’d changed her number yet again.
I was really upset and bought the info from her friend again, but when I finally emailed Denko, she said we’re not dating… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
So the current situation is she said you’re not dating, so you want to talk about what you should do?

##OP
Well, Denko seems to be denying me her email, so I changed my address and I’m pretending to be one of her friends…
I need a way to casually ask what she thinks about me in a conversation… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Can you just throw in a casual “Is the thing with (OP) going okay?” with a regular email?

##OP
Hmm… (´･ω･`) I might send that, sure…
But I’m not sure if she’d talk to her friends about it, and she might already be asleep…

###2ch
You’d better not email her right now.
Don’t blow your relationship at this point, man.

###2ch
Maybe around 500 emails would wake her up?

##OP
Then she’d definitely know it was me! (´･ω･`) Pleeeeease…

###2ch
Be frank with her, man!
Then the conversation can flow naturally.

Do you have a boyfriend?
-> YES
"Ooh, who is it?" (If OP’s name comes up, you’re safe.)

-> NO
"Didn’t someone confess to you, though? Who was that?"
Then you can ask what you want to hear about yourself, OP.

Abruptly asking if she likes or hates you would be a mistake.
Lead the conversation toward what you want to hear.

##OP
Whoa! Thanks! That’s really useful!!!
Lead the conversation, huh? I think I’ll send her an email now.
Earlier I said “It’s ___! I changed my address, so please add me!!”
Denko: “___ from ___? Gotcha! Sorry, I just changed addresses too.
Invite me if you go out drinking again!”

###2ch
Good morning! Sorry to message you now.
I just woke up at this weird time…
Before I get back to bed, I was just thinking…
Denko, you’re really popular, right? So do you have a boyfriend?

Maybe start with something like that?

##OP
Thanks, I sent that. (´･ω･`)

###2ch
If she actually replies at a time like this, I think I’ll fall for Denko’s sweetness.

##OP
I’ve been wanting to know when Denko sleeps, so I’ve watched her window to see when the lights go out.
Usually the lights are out around 1 or 2, so she might be sleeping… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
OP, what about Denko charms you?

##OP
She’s cute, and tidy, and kind, and though she’s a little timid, she tries hard when she wants to.
She’s always putting in lots of effort in the shadows… (´･ω･`)
She’s just so delicate and pure. And she has a strong sense of justice, so she hates twisted things.

###2ch
So basically, Denko would be murdered if this were a TV drama.

###2ch
^ Isn’t that backwards?
As a result of OP being constantly rejected, he kills Denko out of spite…
Please, recognize you were never dating to begin with.

##OP
I HAVE HAD NO INTENTION OF KILLING OR RAPING HER.
I just wish things would go back to normal… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
And what was “normal,” again?

##OP
Just mutually caring for one another? (´･ω･`)
It sounds embarrassing when I write it…

###2ch
And how exactly did that mutual caring go?

##OP
Specifically? Uh, we emailed each other, I put smiley faces on things…
We made lots of eye contact, I greeted her with a smile… I’m getting embarrassed, but yeah, it was a lot of things.

##OP
Since everyone’s warned me that I send too many emails, I’ll only send ten every three days… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Strong sense of justice? Hates twisted things? Wow, she must hate your guts.

###2ch
Take heart, everyone. There’s no mistaking that OP and Denko never “mutually cared for” each other.

##OP
I guess it’s just hard to explain our relationship to a third party… (´･ω･`)
It’s something only we could understand, okay?

###2ch
You’re still at this…
There’s other fish in the sea, and dating sites and all that.
If Denko is eaten up by jealousy, then fine, go back to Denko.
But if not, then get along with your new girl.

##OP
I COULDN’T HAVE ANYONE BESIDES DENKO. DENKO’S THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD I COULD LOVE.

###2ch
»Changed her number and email address
»Changed her number and email address
»Changed her number and email address
»Changed her number and email address
»Changed her number and email address
»Changed her number and email address
…Does he… not notice…
What boyfriend wouldn’t be told about a new phone number and email…?

###2ch
He has no friends, and no experience with women, so this is how he thinks…
Make some friends first. Then we’ll talk.

##OP
I would say I don’t need friends as long as I have Denko.
But then again, I think of you guys as friends… (´･ω･`)
Since you’re all so experienced and giving me good advice…

###2ch
This guy is a serious pain in the ass.

###2ch
Why don’t you meet her face to face?
Then she’ll definitely know how barf-worthy you are.

##OP
I WANT TO BUT THEY MIGHT CALL THE POLICE.
I’ve keeping watch in front of the train station, but I’m suspecting she changed her route… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Confessing over email is so middle school…
Why can’t you tell her directly?

###2ch
Can’t you ask Denko’s friends who sold you her email?

##OP
Yeah, I’ve heard from her friend…
Supposedly Denko is “seriously afraid I’ll murder her someday.”
But I don’t think I can trust them…
It’s important I see the truth with my own ears and eyes… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Okay, just for the sake of argument.

If Denko got a boyfriend and said “OP, you’re creepy as hell, never show yourself to me again!!!!”, what would you do?

Totally hypothetical.

##OP
I guess first I’d ask what she doesn’t like about me? And then I’d try my best to be a guy that satisfies Denko.

###2ch
You’re always… keeping watch…?!

###2ch
She’ll call the police if you go to her house.
You’re keeping watch for her in front of the train station.
You suspect she changed her route.
And you still think she likes you?

##OP
Do you think there’s a misunderstanding?
I just want things cleared up… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Okay, serious time!
OP, you’re pretending to be one of her friends over email, yeah?
Then casually invite her out to karaoke.
Be a little late, send “I’m gonna be late, so you should go in before me!”
Then OP goes into the room, and you’re golden.
Since it’s karaoke, you’ll be good even if she screams! Good luck!

###2ch
I don’t suppose this “Denko” might be little more than a figment of your imagination?
If that’s the case, I don’t think there’s any doubt you have schizophrenia.
Or perhaps “Denko” does exist, but all the outrageous events you write of here are completely wild fantasies.
If that’s the case… I still don’t think there’s any doubt you have schizophrenia.

Okay, maybe I’m way off the mark, but I’m just noting the possibility.
You don’t get anything but what they write on 2channel, but it’s worth thinking about.

###2ch
If Denko figures out it’s the OP emailing her, she’s going to go insane.

##OP
I’m planning to get the info and make a quick getaway.
I don’t think I’ll get caught… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
It’s inevitable, dude.
Do you want her to hate you even more?

###2ch
Denko’s sleeping right beside me.
Her slot was too loose, so she took it up the ass.

##OP
DENKO’S NO WHORE YOU WON’T FOOL ME

##OP
Apparently Denko and some of her friends are going to see the cherry blossoms in Yoyogi Park tomorrow.
I might be able to see Denko from afar, while she’s distracted by the blossoms.
But I could use your advice to make sure I don’t do anything wrong… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
How did you find this out?

##OP
Denko’s friend sold me the info for 3000 yen… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Oh, right. Is that friend who’s selling you info a boy or a girl?

##OP
She’s a girl, but don’t worry, I know I can’t trust her 100%. (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Having to pay for information isn’t making you lose heart?
What would Denko have to say to make you give up??

##OP
I think I’m being very faithful by going as far as paying to know more about Denko.
Giving up at this point would be unthinkable, so I’m not thinking about it.
Because I really don’t know what I would do.

###2ch
Ignoring that this could be a complete troll, Denko’s a real good kid.

I mean, she actually gave the time of day to OP despite him being bullied all his life and still being a creeper even in college.

###2ch
What was this confession email you sent, OP?

[Love letter reposted.]

##OP
H-Hey, guys, stop posting that, it’s embarrassing!
I think things are really going to make progress this afternoon.
No replies since Denko seems to be asleep… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
You should just casually greet her today.

And since it’s hot, you can give her some juice.

##OP
I’ve been thinking about just casually showing up, yeah…
And then meeting Denko in person under the cherry blossoms so I can confess once more… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Er, do you think suddenly running into you would make Denko happy?

##OP
Was it accident or fate that me and Denko met on this earth?
I got the information she was going flower-viewing from a friend, so maybe that could be fate?
And Denko might just realize how fated our meeting is… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
(゜Д゜)

###2ch
Are you going to check to see if Denko leaves on time?

###2ch
I would think this is a troll for sure, but that guy who got arrested a while ago was for real…
There are some serious crazies in the world.

###2ch
Details on guy who got arrested?

###2ch
There was a stalker thread by some art student going on about such-and-such his true love.
Everyone thought he was a troll, but then he got arrested.

###2ch
^ It was Minami.

###2ch
^ Wait, that was real?!

###2ch
Here’s how things are going to go down:
- He’s rejected or reported
- Isn’t it awful that she tramples on my pure feelings?
- How can she not understand that I love her so? Never forgive…
- Denko gets shanked

###2ch
^ JESUS CRHIST NOOOOO
DENKO RUN AWAY

###2ch
I knew a guy who got rejected five times for “not being their type,” but the sixth dated him.
I asked the girl why he dated him, and she seemed to honestly like his determination.
Incidentally, it was the girl’s first boyfriend, so she was worrying a lot about dating, but she fell for the guy’s fierce forwardness.
No reason for OP to give in! So good luck and don’t stab her!

##OP
Whoa! That sounds exactly like me and Denko right now!
That really gives me hope!

###2ch
I wonder what Denko looks like.
Is she cute?
Being targeted by a stalker can’t be good for her mental state, though.

##OP
Yeah, she’s cute, though I don’t know if I could compare her to any celebrities since I don’t really know any…
I guess you could call her the model Japanese beauty.

###2ch
Hm…
And her height? I bet she’s skinny.

##OP
She’s right around 150 cm and yeah, has a slender figure… (´･ω･`)
And she’s a virign. (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Wait, how do you know she’s a virgin.
Did she tell you that herself?

##OP
Um, I just have a feeling she is…? I mean, I KNOW Denko couldn’t possibly be such a loose girl… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Pfft, you’re guessing…?
Well, who wouldn’t believe OP’s got a sixth sense for this stuff?

###2ch
I’m really sorry, dude.

###2ch
Denko might develop a fear of men at this rate.
And why the hell did Denko’s friend give OP info?
Even to make a quick buck, that’s being the worst friend ever…

###2ch
This is definitely reminding me of the Minami thread.

###2ch
Somebody call for a Snake?
I’ll go.

###2ch
^ Please protect Denko.

###2ch
^ You are our ray of light.

###2ch
Where does OP live?

###2ch
Same class as Denko in high school.
They both live with their parents.
College friends going flower-viewing in Yoyogi Park.
Given that stuff, I’m thinking they both live in the city.
And if it’s the Chuo line, I think the college is between Shinjuku and Mitaka.
If it were any lower than that, I don’t think they’d go to Yoyogi for flower-viewing.

##OP
Still not here… (´･ω･`)
Which means not much to write. If I get an email, I expect some advice.

###2ch
By the way, this is what he sent as a followup to the rejection email after peeking through windows for Denko.
[Repost of “Subject: This Is How I Feel.”]

###2ch
He explicitly denied wanting to “kill her or rape her”…
If this is real, that’s nightmarish…

##OP
Guys, don’t come look for me! That’d be embarrassing!
You’ll make me laugh if I see you while I’m confessing…

###2ch
What are you going to go in, a suit?

##OP
Just pants and a shirt… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
What do you think the chances of your confession succeeding are?

##OP
Honestly, probably about fifty-fifty… But I know she’s going to accept! I believe!

###2ch
Poor Denko’s gonna have PTSD.

##OP
Not to spoil anything, but I do have a special backup plan…
I’ll have one of Denko’s friends ask her to buy some alcohol.
Then while Denko is alone, I call to her and bring her under the cherry blossoms. (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Ooh, what a schemer!
Make sure she doesn’t hurt herself when she swoons.

###2ch
You got some real great friends, Denko… lololol

###2ch
Has all the info so far been correct?

##OP
The info I got from Denko’s friend? So far, I guess…
But I still don’t trust her 100%.

###2ch
Where’d OP go?

###2ch
Probably school.

His priorities are all out of whack, but in a way it makes me envious…

##OP
Actually, I’ve been ignoring college. They all call me creepy, so I’ve stopped going… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
If you’re gonna make a thread, answer your damn questions!

Seriously, what an aspie…

##OP
I’m not an “aspie,” okay? I’ll answer anything!
But sorry if I overlook anything… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
So the only info you’ve gotten from the friend is Denko’s contact info and the info about today?

##OP
No, she’s already sold me a bunch of other info.
Like the other day, Denko went with a friend to a soap store and bought some honey-scented body soap.
So now I’m using the exact same stuff as Denko… (´･ω･`)

##OP
And please don’t do this Snake thing, okay?
My entire life is riding on today’s confession, so I’m terrified of someone getting in the way… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Just one thing I want to ask OP.
If Denko’s with a boyfriend at the park, will you stab her?

##OP
She definitely doesn’t have one so it’ll be okay. (´･ω･`)

##OP
Ack! Apparently I’m being misunderstood again!
The reason I’m using the same body soap is just because I thought it might help me know Denko’s feelings and make me think about things.
So it’s not for gross reasons or anything…

##OP
OHMYGODOHMYGOD I GOT AN EMAIL FROM DENKO!!!!
I’M GONNA EXPLOOOODE!!!
Gonna wash my face first like usual!

##OP
Subject: N/A
Contents:
"…? Is this ___?" (My name)

…I think this is the first time I’ve experienced synchronicity…

###2ch
Busteeeeed.

##OP
How did she find me out…? (´･ω･`)
I’m thinking how to reply…
Please, I need a way to avert this crisis…

###2ch
It was probably one of these two:

- What you were sending her (that damn emoticon?)
- She got an email from her real friend

Haha, gonna have to get serious now…

###2ch
This is tough…
She’s clever.
I don’t know how you could reply to keep up the charade.

"Hm? ___?? What about him?"
That’s the best I’ve got…

##OP
You’re all so mean… (´･ω･`)
For now, I sent ^ that email.

###OP
I’m feeling so depressed… (´･ω･`)
Well, for the people supporting me, I’ll keep you up to date on the results of the flower-viewing! Buh-bye!
