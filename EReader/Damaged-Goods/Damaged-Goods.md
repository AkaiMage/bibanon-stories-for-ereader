<img align="right" src="Amputee-chan.png" width="200px">

*Damaged Goods* is a classic from 4chan's (supposedly) "Golden Age" (2006-2007) where a registered male nurse (dubbed "Nurse-kun") asked /b/ for advice when his boring everyday life in a nursing home was interrupted by the arrival of a badly hurt 7-year-old girl. 

At first he merely thought this an interesting anecdote, flavoring it to get the attention of the "fucked-up" /b/tards known as Anonymous, but in an uncharacteristic change of heart, some anons pressed him to actually help the little girl out.

As the events unfold, the magic of the story somehow enchanted the cold heart of Anonymous. The people famous for mercilessly crushing 12-year old girls convinced Nurse-kun to grant the broken soul one friend in the world, and to save her from an unfortunate end. One thing led to another, and for once, the legions of Anonymous found themselves giving the little girl something to smile about. 

It does more than just tell a riveting tale about one guy and a girl; it gives a window into what 4chan was, what this influential community became, and what the site truly meant to the users who lurked and posted at the time.

### 17405827 (OP) ###

/b/, I need your advice on something, since you're probably the ones most qualified to give it.

I'm a nurse-orderly at a nursing home, been there for a year so far, I work the night shift on the west wing. It's not that tough, since most of the residents are so old and medicated that they sleep the night away, only rarely dying or stroking out or getting up to eat their own poop or something. I usually wind up playing with my DS or reading at the nurse's station for the full four hours I'm on watch alone, from 1 to 5.

However, a new patient arrived a month ago, which got my attention. A seven year old girl that was in a car crash that killed her parents, and took her legs, right arm, and right eye. As a ward of the state, and so messed up by all the trauma mentally that no foster parents would touch her, she got sent here when she got out of the hospital. God, she's so cute, she's half-japanese, but has blonde hair, and the rest of her body that didn't get cut away is just perfect, she used to be a gymnast, it seems. I've had to answer her call button several times so far, when she's had to use the restroom in the middle of the night, which meant carrying her from her bed to the toilet, then holding her as she used it, and she always looks away from me when she did so, blushing a little bit.

> The next paragraph is a reference to a sick running joke on /b/, popular in the Civil War Era; that whenever an /b/-tard sees a little girl, they probably might rape her.  
> The reason Nurse-kun posted this is because he mistakenly believed he had to "fit in" with the legendary fucked-up attitude on /b/ to get a response.  
> In later threads, Nurse-kun proves that the post below did not reflect his actual beliefs or intentions at any point in time. In addition, the outpouring of anger by anons persuaded him to help the girl out, rather than turn a blind eye. And thus, a very touching story unfolds out of all the madness.  
> But our job is to record people's recollections as they are presented, not to "clean them up" for public entertainment.  
> You should take this for what it is: he saw a little girl at his unrewarding, difficult job, but felt it would be too risky to try to help her out in her painful situation, so instead he decided to come home and vent about it to other anonymous Internet users.

Anyway, my question: Should I stick it in her pooper (among other things)? I mean, she isn't going to be able to resist, and I can go in there when she's asleep, then cover up her good eye and mouth before she even knows I'm there, with all the drugs she's on. She's so messed up mentally that she probably wouldn't tell anyone, considering she's barely talked to all the shrinks they've had her seeing since the accident. I'm a pretty gentle guy, and there's plenty of lube around here (obviously), and it'd be pretty easy to clean her up afterward, too.

Anyway, what do you think, /b/? Picture somewhat related.

### 17395768

I don't think you have a job. Enjoy your cripple porn.

### 17395802 (OP)

`>>17395768`  
C'mon guys, I need your help here!

### 17395772

You are the cancer that is killing /b/. If this was even 7 months ago before the summer, you would have either been banned or spammed half to death with guro. No one who matters gives a shit about your bosnian bullshit, and /b/ is about the funny, not the drama. Please leave the site now. Leave and never return.

### 17395802

What are you talking about? This shit is actually pretty funny.

### 17395884

`>>17395802`  
/b/ was never funny.

It was "put your head in your hands and ask God, WRYYYYYYYYY"

### 17395984

I fucking loled at the "Should I stick it in the pooper question" right out of left field.

### 17395917

Well, now that he's asking for a serious reply, it's failing. But it's pretty good copypasta by itself.

### 17395968

This is one of the few situations that I have to say no to.

1. She's seven. EW.
2. She's an amputee. EW.

IF 1 and 2 appeal to you, then you have no other valid reason why except that you might lose your job. (Didn't include any moral choice since that's probably the least of your worries)

### 17996138

Why can't you just:

* Get to know her.
* Make her like you.
* Cuddle with her. Hug her, sleep in her bed with her.
* Tell her you love her.

Damnit, now I'm wishing I had a half-japanese amputee to cuddle with.

### 17396238 (OP) ###

`>>17996138`  
Well, she already has a bit of a reputation around here as a trouble patient, since she can become really aggressive when she gets frustrated. So she isn't so popular with the rest of the staff, and since she's so young, there's a lot more reluctance to show any 'inappropriate' affection toward her than, say, to some 90 year old that thinks Hitler's invading Paris every time she wakes up.

The main problem is that she's asleep most of the time I have her alone. What should I do?

### 17396562 (OP) ###

`>>17396429`
> Bullshit. good story, but no-one ever sends an orphan to a nursing home, and if she has to go, they use fucking bedpans.

Uh, yeah...they keep orphans with extreme medical and physical care needs in all the orphanages, the ones on every street corner. The ones with qualified nurses and doctors to manage their constant care. And they totally just toss the one-armed girl a bedpan, and cut the cord on the call button.

Don't try and tell me how the system works, asshole, I'm part of the system, and it doesn't fucking work at all.

### 17396426 (OP) ###

`>>17396289`
> Pictures are required before further consultation.

Well, I haven't taken any [pictures] yet (official policy is no photography by the staff for legal reasons, someone got busted in 2001 for taking pictures of the funny things senile old people do and posting them on the net), and I don't go back to work for another 10 hours. So I have no pictures of her to give you.

### 17396690 (OP) ###

`>>17396462`
> Take pictures tomorrow and post them exactly 24 hours from the time of this comment. Deal?

I'll try. But they do random searches on our bags since a new policy was enacted in June, in reaction to another nurse that was stealing narcotics. Thus, the main reason I've been hesitant up till now.

### 17397176

What the fuck is wrong with you? Joking about rape is fine, but actually planning it.. isn't so funny. I mean, not only has she gone through a lot of trauma, but now you just want to put her through more. And if you gain a relationship with her just to do this, she's going to have major trust issues for the rest of her life.

Here's my advice to you: kill yourself. It would do the world some good.

### X17397725

didn't happen, he's lying, no pics, etc.

just some unimaginably sick, lonely individual making up a story--probably masturbating (like myself) to each reply.

### 17397272

`>>17397176`  
I have to agree with this anonymous if OP is real. My second opinion is that you should fall in love with her and make her life a living paradise.

### 17397304

The most serious post this anonymous has ever made on /b/:

If you really cared about this little girl's future, you would not rape her. You realize that would fuck up her already fucked up life even more. You'd just be hurting her. Don't nurses have to take the Hippocratic Oath, too?

### 17397050

`>>17396929`  
I think your only real problem here is the objectification of the girl. I mean, I don't have anything against you wanting to fuck her, that's fine. Rape is bad though, and having sex with a 7 year old permenantly damages them so don't actually go through with it.

If I had a bone to pick with you as far as morals go, it would be that you need to stop treating her like an object and treat her like a person. Buy her some toys and make the quality of her life better, wait a few years and after a real relationship has formed and she's past puberty, THEN consider sticking it in her pooper.

Until then, masturbate. Lots.

### 17397249

`>>17397050`  
I think buying toys to someone who spends their days as a cripple in a bed is more of an insult.

Also, speaking of permanent damage. she seems pretty wrecked already. So relative to a normal 7 years old the percentual fuck-up factor could in no way be as great even if he rape her in a fully conscious state.

### 17397444

`>>17397332`

The internet is for lulz and rape, but not planning rape IRL.

I'd post that picture of the fag from IGN who said, "Rape is just suprise sex lol" in the barbershop, shortly before discovering his barber's daughter had been raped.

Online ideas/conversations do not transfer well to IRL.

### 17397410

Just to let you know, anonymous will turn on you harder than you will ever imagine if you're being truthful.

We'll hunt you down. Make fun of this if you want, but you won't be safe.

### 17396929 (OP)

`>>17396803`

Well fine, if you want honesty, *I was kind of hoping more people would tell me not to do it.*

I mean, HA HA, I'M POSTING IN /B/, but seriously, *I feel bad for her too.*

> Of course, I also feel PENIS-engorged for her, because my words cannot convey just how cute and soft and warm she is.

### 17397258

`>>17396929`

Anon has feelings too. We understand.

Don't raep her, befriend her.

### 17397156 ###

There's a difference between wanting to fuck someone until they're blind and what you're describing.

You don't want to stick it in the pooper at all.

*You're feeling something entirely different*, aren't you?

I suggest finding out what she likes to read, then reading it aloud to her. Gain her trust and adoration, since *you know inside you would rather perform a barrel roll* then raping a 7-year old amputee who had just lost her parents.

You know what to do.

### 17396289 ### 

adopt her?

### 17397116

I think it is pretty obvious that God wants you to adopt her and to be a good father for her, so you must fight your sinfulness every day again and again.

Yeah, he's into some crazy shit, God!

### 17396803

Adoption? not a bad idea actually... seconded. if you're connecting with her, it might do both of you some good to take her in, if you can.

> and if you still feel the need to fuck her, then it can legally be incest as well. bonus points!

### 17396762 (OP) ###

And for all those people telling me to adopt her, I'd love to, she seems like she was a really great kid, bright, outgoing, cheerful, before the accident. The problem is that people involved in the care of kids in the system often find it way harder to adopt them than someone with a less sterling record from OUTSIDE the system. It's fucked up, but that's the way it is.

### 17397047

`>>17396762`  
you couldn't strike a deal with some good friend/relative of yours then? they adopt, you take care of her?

### 17397332 ###

MORALITY?

ON MY /B/?!

What is this shit? If I wanted to learn about conscience, I'd go to my Ethics and Morality class at school. The internet is for lulz and raep.

### 17397471 (OP) ###

Well, um...the problem is, if I'm nice to her, and treat her kindly, more as a friend or father-figure, she'd be likely, as a positive effect, to report it to the facility's psychiatrist during one of their sessions, in all innocence, who might then feel obligated to report that to the administrator. Who would then probably fire me for showing inappropriate affection, woo family services catch-22ism.

### 17397598

What, does the staff often just rape the shit out of the patients?

### 17397596 ###

What kind of affection are you allowed to show? This seems pretty stupid to me, I mean, she obviously needs some kind of friend, I'm sure your supervisor and her psychiatrist would agree.

### 17397589 & 17397642

She sounds like a smart girl, so talk to her as an adult, and treat her well.

If she knows that you're risking your job to take care of her, she should be smart enough to avoid the topic with the psychiatrist.

I mean, if she does start to like you, she'd want want you to stay around, right?

### 17397890 (OP) ###

`>>17397589`

I've considered that, too. I mean, she's actually REALLY smart, like, she was in a school for the gifted before the accident, and her mother was a child psychologist, so they gave her a lot more freedom and choice than the average kid would get. And she was pretty gifted athletically, too, which just makes the whole thing all the more tragic.

Of course, she's also pretty broken now...extremely withdrawn, rare she says three words the whole day; at the same time, she lashes out at anyone that tries to get too close. She actually bit a psych intern who was trying some play therapy with her in the hospital hard enough to draw blood, before she was transferred here. The real problem is, if I were to try and form a bond with her, honestly, I'm afraid she'd do something to get me in trouble just to try and make me leave her alone, even if she really wants some affection.

This would be a lot easier if she was less traumatized.

### 17397936 ###

FUCKING BEFRIEND HER fucker  
UPDATE A BLOG ABOUT IT  
and I SWEAR I WILL MAKE A MANGA OUT OF IT  
it's true, im a doujinshi-drawing weeaaboohoo.  
and this story is GOLD drama material

just think about it;

average /b/tard MEETS a shy half-japanese blonde cute one-eyed orphaned amputee loli

THIS IS THE NEW DENSHA OTOKO

### 17397392 ###

The toy thing might be true though.

Lets all think of things someone with one arm and one eye can enjoy.

* Teddy bears
* Books
* Movies

That's all I can come up with, I'm sure the rest of Anonymous has some better suggestions.

### 17397451

Def Leppard.

### 17397453

prostheses

### 17397572

Well shit - raep it is.

### 17397572

Put her body in a robot.

AND MAKE A LOLI-MECHWARRIOR §§§

### 17397501

Buy her a barbie and rip off the legs and right arm and color over the right eye.

### 17397693

Buy her a lute, her hearing is the only thing not affected by the accident, and the lute can be played with one hand. Plus it's a pretty inexpensive item.

### 17397829

`>>17397693`  
Faggot. You can't play a lute with one hand. Do you even know what a lute is?

### 17397595

Be her foster parent

### 17397697

Wait a minute...male nurse?

GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY.

### 17398173 ###

HELO /B/    
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOU ALL TURNED INTO FUCKING GAIA WUSSES AND FAILURES. PLEASE, EVERYONE WHO SAID "PLZ DONT RAEP LOLI NO LEIK REAP", GB2 /GAIA/

### 17398170 ###

My personal suggestion? Music and books.

There are plenty of devices that can help someone with one arm keep a book steady and open, etc, listening to and appreciating different types of music is always an option, and she can still write. If she's as smart as she said, she might be able to vent eventually through writing or drawing. Just give her stimulating, fun, but not patronizing things she can do in this condition.

She might never open up to you, but that's ok; you're just trying to help, and it sounds like the rest of the staff really hasn't bothered with this kind of thing.

(By the way, this scenario involves no rape whatsoever.)

Best case scenario? She realizes that her life's not over and she has people around that are genuinely trying to make her happy.

Gunslinger Girls.

In that anime, an organization takes unwanted little girls with severe physical problems and rebuilds them into brainwashed cyborg assassins.

Sometimes they even get raped. Though most of the time it's just mentally.

Most of of the time.

### 17397874

`>>17397848`  
Thanks for delivering, sounds cool.

### 17398333 (OP) ###

> _/b/ demands a pic by this time tomorrow._

you know, the main reason I would have not to post pictures is that she's a pretty distinctive girl. I mean, how many half-japanese blonde green-eyed (singular) one-armed, no-legged seven year olds are there? That idiot I mentioned before got busted just for posting random old people, and there are millions of those.

### 17398890 (OP) ###

> _Just curious, but does she have stumps? Any possibility of her getting at least prosthetic legs?_

Actually, she gets bussed to a rehab facility at the hospital almost every day, where she's learning to use prosthetic legs, and an arm. It's like it's the one thing she actually cares about anymore, I hear the staff there are amazed at the progress she's making.

It makes sense, though, because she really hates her wheelchair...the first time I answered one of her calls at night, I'd wheeled it out to put her in it, since that's standard procedure, but she asked me not to use it, so I carried her, instead. I guess that's the first time I thought about her in an illegal manner, really.

Anyway, she wears the prosthetic arm during the day, but I'm not around then, so I've never actually seen her using it. I have seen it in her room, though; it's a nice model, probably the best in the whole facility. I guess her parents had a pretty responsible life insurance policy, so she doesn't have to deal with substandard prosthetics, at least...has a nice prosthetic eye, too, looks just like her real one, as much as a fake one can, anyway. Of course, the scarring over her eye kind of helps give it away.

### 17399199 (OP) ###

> _loli haet raep. lonely, orphaned loli loev caring man. years later, borderline loli secks for you._

I know, I know. I mean, I'd prefer not to rape, too! It's just that it's a really complex situation, and this is /b/. I figured I'd get 'stick it in her pooper' out of the way, to get more productive responses.

### 17399274 ###

She have no relatives or anything?

If you manage to adopt and breed her into a quality /b/tard you've done the world a great service anyway. Hell, you could probably have a tear jerking bestseller written about it too. That based on a real story stamp will make it sell half a million examples in one day. Then you marry her and buy 4chan of doug and found your own kingdom, expanding all over the world, and when you die at the age of 160 you'll have your hot 1/4 japanese loli grangrandchildren at your bed crying, and the entire world would mourn the first king of Terra.

Think of what you'll be missing if you don't adopt her!

### 17400270 (OP) ###

Well, I guess I have to try, at least.

I'll bring her something christmasy tonight...she's been getting especially depressed since the facility started putting up decorations a week ago, poor kid. Good way to see how receptive she is to interacting with me outside emergencies, too.
Not sure what'd be 'appropriate' or disposable enough, though...I know you're hardly the people to ask about 'appropriate' anything, but any ideas, /b/?

### 17400541 ###

it's too late for a christmas advent calendar (love those stupid things) - maybe a christmas orange chocolate, the ones you get to whack really hard.

If candy is against the rules even better, just go "shhhh" and tell her not to let the other staff know she has it.

*Here, the troll from 17398173 ignites a shitstorm of argument over the worthiness of this thread, hilarity ensues*

### 17400857 ###

> _get the fuck out of my 4chan, gaiafags._
> _RAEP AND PICTURES_

If it bothers you so much, then maybe you SHOULD go to Gaia, because one little thread out of a hundred in /b/ alone (and only then for a couple of hours) annoying the fucking hell out of you means you're too sensitive for the crap that gets thrown about in /b/ anyway. After all, we are in actuality the same person.

### 17400991 ###

> _<3 bikko, but i think the spam has scared off the op. nice going, idiots._

No, I'm still here, I was just grabbing something from the kitchen. Cute attempt at internet dramas with the flooding, though. And *I'm* the cancer that is killing /b/? Nigra, please.

And for the record, I had actually thought about the red prosthetic eye thing myself once, embarassed as I am to admit it. I'm not that big a Rozen Fag, though.

(Though, she will have some delicious prosjoints...)

### 17402096 ###

/b/ is the cancer that is killing you!

YOU DIDN'T END WITH DESU!

### 17401631 (Desu Girl) ###

That's cause I'm OP's girlfriend from future. He just made me look like that Suiseiseki girl from that Rozen anime. Yeah, I'm the criple and this is the year 2026. I have "delicious prosjoints" and all. I don't end my sentences with "desu" when he's not home because even after all these years it feels sort of silly.

### 17402997 (Desu Girl) ###

> _you would fuck with her head even more_

Oh come on, I and OP are going to be happy together.

### 17402270 (OP) ###

> _Can a half japanese chick even HAVE blonde hair and green eyes?!_

Sure they can. I mean, I've seen one myself (you know, in her room). Apparently, her father was almost stereotypically scandanavian, bright blonde hair, blue eyes, six foot+, etc. She's still got pretty clearly Japanese-y features, mostly (luckily, of the cute kind, not the 'oh god, i see why the men raped nanking' kind), but most of her coloration is equally pretty clearly from his side of the family. Her skin is somewhere in between a pale japanese and a pale (rather than goldish) fjordish.

Frankly, I'd say she won the genetic lottery, too bad about the non-predetermined alterations.

### 17402966 ###

> _The rest of her body that didn't get cut away is just perfect_

This is the perfect exemplar of what it is to be a /b/tard.

> _Rape is bad though, and having sex with a 7 year old permenantly damages them so don't actually go through with it._

Wouldn't want to damage the one with all the amputatiuons and mental problems, I guess...

### 17403691 (OP) ###

> So OP, have you already determined your course of action?

Ok, OP here: I won't be poopering her in the foreseeable future. I mean, when /b/ can come down at least in the slight minority against doing a barrel roll into a loli, it clearly isn't the right course of action, though I guess I did know that already.

I really wish I could get you guys a recording of her voice. She doesn't have an accent, because she was born and raised here in America, and her mother (the Japanese half) comes from a long line of Japanese-Americans (who disowned her, I guess, when she married Mr. Swedish Meatball, because loli's relatives/contact information is nonexistent, just social workers), but her voice...well, it's just the most beautiful thing I'd ever heard, when she first spoke to me (about the wheelchair).

Even as flat and brusque as it was, it was like hearing an angel whisper hymns, and I still get goosebumps every time I've heard it since. I can't wait for tonight...I think I should bring her something else, maybe a tiny little keychain sized stuffed doll or something, or maybe a little wristband...any other ideas, guys?

### 17403890 ###

A little stuffed doll could be a nice little gift. Though, if you could get away with it with the administration, give her a normal sized teddybear or something.

> _If she blushes in an innocent way from simple human touch after her parents have been killed and her body maimed, then either she has the willpower of ten men or her priorities are somewhat screwy._

She's also biting orderlies and speaking less than three words a day. And it was the fact that he had to hold her in the bathroom so she could take a fucking piss, not a simple touch. You make a good point though, anonymous.

### 17403984 (OP) ###

Um, I have to admit, she didn't seem to get at all distressed until she may have possibly noticed me looking down there, which I quickly stopped doing, just before I caught her looking away as well, out of my peripheral vision.

I was being pretty unprofessional, it's true, since I'd never had any inclination to look at any other of my patients taking a piss before, but then, half of my patients before her were in depends, and the other half, well, I prayed for their merciful deaths every time.

She's not a robot, or animuishly designed to be the perfect cold-hearted Rei-clone. She's a real girl.

I'll bring it up at next week's meeting...perhaps a possibility of allowing individual gifts, with the potential that it could improve morale with the rest of the patients to grandparent her a bit (well, the non-racists, anyway).

Look, I tried to post a longer version, but it disappeared, so I'll sum up for all of you cunts: Someone in a professional caretaking role for a child taking a picture of that child, clothed or not, then posting it on the internet, is a BAD IDEA.

This is not even taking into account her particular uniqueness, since by the time that picture had made its way around the internets, finally winding up on some disabled children's charity or advocacy group, someone will have wondered who she is, and where it came from.

And, being as unique as she is, they will find her, then they will wonder who took the picture, and they will find me. And at that point, clothed or no, innocent or no, I will be fucked in ways too numerous to mention for the rest of my life, whether I am ever charged, or convicted, of anything.

Think about it, people.

Frankly, all of you fucking Wanna/b/ees that are all up in arms over my situation need to take a step back and take a good hard look at both it, and at your mindless idealism.

Yeah, in an ideal world, she wouldn't be in the situation she's in. Why do bad things happen to good people? She certainly didn't deserve to have her parents taken away, any more than she deserved to lose her limbs, or she deserved to have her psyche fractured into a thousand pieces by the trauma of both those events.

But she they did. And she did. And what does life hold for her now? People in social work don't want to admit it, but people like her are completely fucked for the rest of their lives. No honest foster family honestly wants to deal with someone like her, because they're normal human beings, even the saintly ones. It's just too hard. They'd fail. And she'd get sent back into institutional care, with a mark on her record regarding her rejection, which would make it even more likely anyone else would accept her next time.

### 17407252 (OP) ###

And after this process repeated itself a few times, if the first, or subsequent attempts, ever happened at all, she'd wind up in institutional care again, permanently. Probably before she even turns ten years old.

And once she's there, she's there until she's eighteen, at least. Another eight+ years of no love, no affection, minimal contact, surrounded by senile and angry and sad old people and distant caretakers. Maybe she'll get sent to a school for special needs children, assuming they find one that'll take her, with her ever-increasing behavioural problems.

And they WILL increase, the more she's emotionally neglected, it's a guarantee with the sort of problems she has. Even if she masters her legs and arm, even if she can use the bathroom by herself, her life will be an ongoing empty pain that will only grow with every year. Odds are good that she'd find a way to kill herself, with her intelligence and impressive willpower, before she's fifteen.

### 17407403 (OP) ###

So, what's your solution?
Magically turn back time to make the accident not have happened? Magically heal her mind so that her body's imperfections alone are less likely to destroy her future? Maybe you could magically heal both of them, and she'd probably be adopted right away.
There is no magic. The world doesn't work like that. She has no future, not a future she deserves, anyway.
The fact of the matter is that I'm probably her best chance for a future worth living, one way or another. You may not want to admit it, but it's the truth. Go fuck the holes you cut in your son's dolls and cry yourself to sleep over the injustices of the world if you aren't strong enough to face them, fag.

## Thread 2A 12/17/06(Sun)13:54:38 No.17445483

### 17445483 (OP) ###

Since I got so many requests in my first thread to keep you all updated on the one-armed, one-eyed loli situation, I thought I'd post what happened during last night's shift. I'm still somewhat hesitant to start a blog, so this'll just have to do for the time being.

Anyway, I picked her up a teeney little stuffed bear, about the size of her hand, and one of those chocolate oranges you smack to split open, and stuffed the toy into the pocket of my scrubs, and the candy into my bag next to my DS, before I headed inside. The security guard at the reception desk, a big indian guy that's always talking about MTV, did a short search, guess it was my lucky night, but only checked the bag, so it was my lucky night indeed. We exchanged mindless pleasentries and I headed to the break room, to check the night's duty log.

Anyway, to make a boring part of a story short, I eventually wound up back at the night station to start my shift, and killed time as best I could until around 1. When I saw that the coast was clear, I hooked the beeper set up to recieve calls from the patient's rooms onto my waistband, for when we're away from the station, and I headed for her room with the bear and orange chocolate in one of my hands.

I listened at the door for a minute or so, noting that there was light coming from under it, (but she's apparently been scared of the dark since the accident, so she always keeps at least a small light on, even when sleeping), trying both to listen for activity and to work up my courage, then finally opened it up.

### 17445916 (Desu Girl) ###

![](img/1165259115830s.jpg)

Oh OP, you were always so romantic.

### 17445935 (OP) ###

I found her looking my way, in a mixture of very mild surprise and annoyance. She asked me what I wanted as I stepped in, closing the door behind myself, and walking up to her bedside, where she was propped up with the pillows behind her back, frowning.

I just smiled as gently as I could, and I took my hand out from behind my back, opening it to reveal the dual offerings. She blinked at that, staring at them for a beat or two before looking up at me again, and frowning again...then asking, and I quote, "What?" They were for her, I said...explaining that the other nurses had noticed that she seemed to be feeling down lately, and that a little early christmas gift might help. Then, as I set them down on the corner of her little bedside table, beside her, turning the bear to 'face' her, I also explained that the people in charge here probably wouldn't approve of the nurses, and my, giving them to her, so...could she keep it a secret?

### 17446694 ###

![](img/1160073471422s.jpg)

You will continue this story or this man will eat your face.

### 17446086 (OP) ###

I gave her a little wink when I said that last bit, and brought my finger up to my lips in the standard 'shhhh' position. After another few seconds, she turned her gaze from me to the bear, the confused, almost upset look on her face still there, and was silent for almost a minute...I almost had a heartattack, it was beating so fast, worrying she'd react in the worst way possible...but then she mumbled something I almost didn't catch, save for my heightened state of awareness.

"Thank you."

I just smiled again as she refused to look directly at me, turning her good eye downward, instead, into her own lap, and after a moment's debate, reached out and lightly touched the top of her head with my open hand, for just a half-second, before I turned around again, and moved to walk out of the room, barely able to control the butterflies in my stomach. I snuck a peek back as I closed the door again behind myself, after stepping out, and saw her reaching for the bear...a great success, I'd say.

I quietly opened the door again around 3, to find her sleeping, curled up on her left side, the bear still in her hand, near her chest. 'An angel' doesn't even come close, /b/, and I felt better than I had in weeks, cleaned up the foil and the couple pieces left from the chocolate quietly, and stepped back out again.
So far, so good.

Seriously. I'll even request a ban.

### 17446406 (OP) ###

>"into her own lap"
> lol, legless people have laps?

Uh, yeah. She only lost roughly half her legs, in transfemoral amputations. Or, what, do you need knees to qualify?

Anyway, there isn't much more to tell, I just finished up my shift as best I could, in a mixture of nervousness and barely suppressed glee. Nothing much else happened.

Oh, I finished Hard ROCK mode on EBA, but that isn't really salient to the main topic of discussion.

### 17446629 (OP) ###

> is it hard becoming a nurse? I want a little amputee loli

I completed my Registered Nursing program after I finished my bachelor's. It wasn't as 'hard' as med school, I guess, but I didn't really feel like another four years of school and then a bunch more years of interning after that at the time. I had been considering becoming a paramedic, but didn't, for reasons I don't really want to get into here.

Anyway, it's a pretty rewarding career, when the doctors aren't being total dickheads, and the patients are vomiting or pissing or shitting all over you. Uh, maybe that's what drew me to /b/, actually.

### 17445745 ###

Bullshit, mainly because Terrys choco oranges are the HARDEST FUCKING candies to get ready to eat.

### 17446578 ###

I was the guy who suggest the christmas chocolate orange - I didnt think it would be TOO hard for a one armed, no legged, one eyed, 7 year old, half japanese, blonde, blue eyed loli to break.

### 17446808 (OP) ###

Shit, I knew I forgot to mention something.

I hadn't really tried one of the chocolate orange things before, so I asked the checkout clerk how hard it would be to 'open' one. She said you have to whack it pretty hard, but that's all part of the fun, right?, and laughed. I laughed too, and left the store. Turning it over in my head on my way home to get ready for work, I decided it probably would be a bit frustrating for her, and I didn't want that, so when I got home, I gave it a couple of medium-strength whacks on my table, then felt around the outside of the foil. It seemed to have seperated somewhat inside, so I left it at that state, then got ready, and the story proceeded as I told it.

And her eyes are/were green, by the way.

### 17446868 (OP) ###

> Holy shit. This has the scent of Truth.
> You're back at your normal time, 14ish est, and there was no pooper sticking.

I'm strongly considering it, and looking through some webpages on local laws.

I have a lawyer cousin, so I can get some free legal advice if it comes to it, he'll be at the family's for christmas...I'm considering telling them about her then, and asking their advice on my consideration of trying to help her.

I won't be mentioning poopering to them, no, by the way.

### 17446887

Boring and quite obviously made up, so much so that I didn't even bother to read to the loli raep scene. Seriously, could you make it anymore obvious? You sound like you're writing a novel, not recounting some event.

I usually work five or six days a week, probably more this month since I don't have a 'family' (spouse/kids) to spend the holidays with. I have tonight off, so I'm a bit nervous about what's happening there while I'm at home, but, not much I can do about that.

I'll probably just spend christmas day with the family, it's about an hour's drive each way, so I'll be seeing her then, and christmas eve, anyway.

### 17447209 ###

you're a good man, through and through. if anyone can adopt her it'll be you.

Uh, yeah, I'm really goiong to let slip the name of the place I work at. When I have at least ten percent of the responses telling me I need to die in prison rape funtime, and they want to call the local police on my sick ass.

I need to afk for ten minutes or so, getting buzzed on my intercom, brb

### 17447099 (Sarafan) ###

Let me throw in my two cents, even though they don't matter. You have an opportunity of a lifetime- you can really get in on this girl if you do it right. However, in light of your recent events, you may be walking closer to the creepy factor if you don't watch it.

I mean, let's look at it from her perspective. Someone busts into your room at 1 in the fucking morning and hands you candy and a bear and tells you to keep a secret. Kinda disturbing. However, it seems like you did it well- if she's holding the bear, it means that she probably appreciated the gift.

Here's what I would do. Stay back for a little bit. Don't get too suddenly grabby, or else the little alarm bells in her head will go off. I don't care how messed up she is, she's a normal human in the head, and she'll probably read you like a book. Keep low and keep nice. Visit her occasionally, preferably if you actually have something to do. Just make your way closer, where you are in her "line of sight", just not obnoxiously so.

And good luck. If you get loli sex, *I will hate you forever.*

**FOREVER.**

### 17447374

`>>17447099`

To an extent I agree with you. Now that you've brought the whole scenario out of fantasy loli land and into reality, it's certainly... dramatic?

However, if OP is completely honest as to her reaction, it could mean that she wanted it. Of course, nightly visits like that are out of the question.

On the other hand, she may have felt put upon to thank him... orz

Not that you should feel despair! You did great OP!

Sometimes I wonder if people at 2chan have these sort of encouraging, nice threads all the time.

### 17447562 ###

You know OP if you [didn't] try to seduce her and instead gave her the platonic love and emotional support she needs to recover after so great a trauma, you would be one of the finest human beings I have ever heard.

'course we would tell you to gtfo, but you would still be a really good human being.

### 17447653

It's one or the other - adopt or sweet loli sex.

.......I'd advise you to go the adoption method. It sounds a hell lot more heartwarming, and there are enough loli pics/stories on the interbutt.

Kindness is something the world shouldn't run out of.

...Regardless of your secret inner dark feelings.

### 17448551

I agree with the person who said that it might look creepy to her, but then it's hard to know exactly how it went unless you were there. I suggest acting like an oni-chan. Big, strong and laughing all the time. If you do that and she starts feeling like a little sister, then as Japan has told us, she will automatically start lusting for oni-chan PENIS!

### 17447959

This brings Lolita (the book) to mind. Lola's parents are dead, mother by car accident, and she is left in the care of Humbert, the step-father. Young Lolita is all into the sex at first, but she gets pretty psychologically fucked later on and comes to haet Humbert. Eventually she runs away from him and believes that he ruined her life.

OP, I'd think about this.

### 17448263 (OP) ###

OP here. Sorry about that, my new neighbour from down the hall needed help moving his christmas tree inside. I'm the only person he knows here so far, and he's been pretty nice and generous so far (free beer and chinese food, woo), so what was I to do?

Anyway, I live alone, so my computer being on isn't, uh, generally a problem. And, um, too many posts to answer, amidst the spam, so I'll just start again from here on.

### 17448732 (OP) ###

Uh, yes, adoption is the most likely course, with the other major choice being 'do nothing', which I would feel like shit over, but remains a possibility simply due to the overwhelmingness of the undertaking.

Poopering, for the last time, isn't on the menu for the foreseeable future, and I haven't even done anything inappropriate to her yet, people. I haven't touched her in any manner outside the boundries of my profession and her position as my patient, and I haven't introduced her to any sexually inappropriate material, verbal or otherwise.

Oh, and for the record, all of you Taxi Driver wannabes out there furiously masturbating to the thought of proving to the world just how big a man you are, needing tweezers to do so be damned: find me one place where I've actually said I planned, or even WANTED to rape her. Go ahead.

Faggots.

### 17452208  ###

> (Commenting on the first post he made)
> OP, you wrote this. It's not like nobody saves this threads, you know. \s

This is /b/, retard. Do you honestly think I would've gotten anything but 'STICK IT IN HER POOPER' or 'DO A BARREL ROLL' if I'd played it more or less straight, simply saying that I was having some very illegal feelings mixed in with less illegal ones toward her? I mean, it's not like I just wandered in here from gaia or something, shithead, I was a /b/tard long before I ever met her.

And again, there's a difference between acknowledging a possibility and stating an intention of acting upon it. GBTBASICLOGIC.

### 17448932

This is a girl with no legs, one arm, and a fake eye, who just lost her parents in a car accident. What you're doing is good, and if she ends up enjoying your company enough, adopting her would be good.

But if you even molest her I swear to God I will track you down and turn you into the authorities. With all the information you've given, it wouldn't really be too difficult.

### 17448940

`>>17448732`

True, Rape isn't the eventual outcome. But think of it like `>>17447917` said.

Do you honestly think anybody could love her but you, [OP]? I know this is a bit heavy, but think about it seriously.

No Legs, 1 arm, 1 eye, half-jap with apparently no family who cares enough to take her in after this tragedy. Only a /b/tard could love her.

But that's way, way, way into the future. Right now you have to think about now.

Seriously though, keep up the good work!

### 17451161

OFFICER? THERE'S A MAN ON THE INTERNET WHO SAYS HE'S GOING TO RAPE A LITTLE GIRL... NO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS NAME IS... OR WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE... OR WHERE HE LIVES... OR WHERE HE WORKS. NO, I DON'T KNOW THE LITTLE GIRL'S NAME... OR WHERE SHE LIVES... OR WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE... HELLO? HELLO?

### 17449025 (OP) ###

And to address the potential creepiness of the situation last night, now that I'm reminded by this post: Yeah, I know. But how else should I have done it? 'Oh yes, go right ahead and start urinating, dear, I've got you, you won't fall in, oh, and by the way, here's a stuffed animal and some candy'? I tried to be as nonthreatening and gentle as I could be, and it seemed pretty clear, to me at least, that nobody had spoken to her this way, to a sad, lonely little girl, as a person that actually cared about her, rather than her making 'progress' in her treatment, more or less since the accident. That was why she didn't have much to say.

I don't intend to proceed straight to 'visiting her room' all night every night from now on. Geez, I'm not that dumb or crude. I'll just be around, available, and a source of kindness if she wants it, and things can proceed from there. She's a smart girl, after all, I'm not going to treat her like some tv-land retardo-kid.

### 17448862

`>>17448212`
> Only issue with her body state is that within a few years her muscles will have degenerated enough to make her appear as a crippled old woman, unable to clean her vagoo, pooper, and whatnot.

I wondered about that too but, when thinking about it, isn't she still able to do simple exercices? Like sit ups, for example. That would keep her body smooth and delicious. I, for one, do sit ups all the time and it works with me. If I had an amputee loli to keep cheerful, I'd do sit ups with her. Then I'd tickle her when she says she's tired :3

### 17449149 (OP) ###

For the record, it's entirely possible for amputees, even multiple ones, to retain muscle tone and fitness. It just takes exercise, the same as for anyone else, though they generally can't do all the usual ones available to the more full-bodied.
She's working very hard at her physical rehab, perhaps because it helps her forget about her difficulty with her mental rehab, unfortunately...

### 17450393 (OP) ###

I'm not really sure about that (her family). There was nobody listed as next of kin on her records, just social workers. Gossip around the workplace, passed on from those of us with friends at the hospital she spent her first two months in, is that her father was a first generation american-fjordian (specific country not mentioned, might have been sweden) only child, and his parents were dead, no information on grandparents. Her mother was a multi-generation-in japanese-american, whose family hasn't made ANY attempt to even contact them, and may have refused to answer any of the various workers' attempts at getting information/attention from them. Guess she pissed them off pretty badly by marrying whitey.

Nobody even vaguely japanese looking has ever visited her since the accident, and from what I've heard, her social worker has been having no luck whatsoever with any sort of family placement...and she has a better chance of growing a new arm and legs than getting placed in a group home or foster care.
The system sucks.

OP, DOES THE LOLI LOOK LIKE THIS?!

### 17451535 (OP) ###

Well, as far as coloration goes, it's rreasonably close. Hairstyle's not too far off, either, at least since the accident. I think she may have had longer hair before, but it's been cut relatively short, since she was getting really frustrated and worked up at not being able to brush her own hair anymore, and refused to let anyone else do it for her...I mean, think about it, her mother probably used to do it for her, and...

...anyway, I guess it's sort of close.

### 17451104 (OP) ###

She's not retarded. She's very intelligent, it's just that she's been so badly traumatized that she's developed severe, SEVERE PTSD. I mean, PTSD that makes fucked up vietnam veterans look healthy. Withdrawing from human contact, depression, anxiety, aggression, fear of the dark, nightmares, she's voiced the thought that she has no future, and nobody wants her anymore, to therapists, she practically goes into a fear-coma every time she has to ride in a vehicle somewhere, as a trigger from the crash...

I really wish there was magic in the world.

*I'd do anything for there to be magic that could make her, make everything, all right again.*

### 17451326

Hey OP. You're now Nurse Otoko.

YOU CAN DO IT, NAASU!

Also start bringing her small gifts each night. Just a brief visit, but the regularity and stability of it is important. Also, say it's for the 12 days of Christmas, or something like that.

### 17452350

What is OP thinking right now! What is he doing! I can only wonder...

You have been given the winnest opportunity of a lifetime. Don't fuck it up!

### 17451331

Everyone on /b/ is playing a role. Trolling, counter trolling, switching sides, spamming, all in the name of lulz.

This is the first time, I've stepped out of character as a /b/tard and just said what I really meant in two years of posting. This whole story just tastes too much like reality to me, and even if it is just a story, it's a damn interesting one.

There are two many inconsistencies, and the OP keeps shifting his perspective between, caring for the girl out of an inborn sense of paternal duty, and the animalistic cunning of a predator.

If this was a story it would be polished and have no holes. Everything would match up and just be too perfect. That's not how life works though.

I sincerely hope that if you do love this girl and have feelings for her that are not merely sexual, that you will try to protect her from the harsh realities being a ward of the state involves, and gently reintergrate her in to normal society.

If you do adopt her be kind and let her find out who she [truly] is, now that who she was [has died].

Also you best kick the shit out of anyone who ever makes a crack about the way she looks.

### 17451742

`>>17451104`

You think other people will treat a 1 armed 1 eyed no legged half-jap like an equal? No. Regardless of her intelligence, the majority of people will treat her like shit. Nobody will ever see her in her prosthetics and with her eye patch across the dance floor at the High School dance and think "Hey, that's the girl with whom I want to dance."

At best, she will be condescended to. That's fucking worse. She could get a pity boyfriend who is going out with her to look good in front of other people, "Hey, I'm going out with the severe cripple!" He might even marry her, but in a few year the charm of being Mr. Nice Guy will wear off, and he'll find an excuse to leave her.

OP, are you doing this because you feel bad for her? Do you think, deep down inside, she would want that? I apologize for sounding harsh, but if you are going to adopt her out of pity alone, just forget about it. I believe you aren't, but really think about it.

### 17451993

if you do anything awfull to her while she is in that state then you have probably assured your seat in hell. do yourself a favor and leave her alone. you are already a terrible person for even having such thoughts about a girl who has gone though such a terrible accident. but if you are OK with an eternity in hell then by all means, do your buisiness. afterwards you'll probably end up slitting your wrist because you will realize how shitty a person you are.

### 17452562 (OP) ###

OP here, pointed out because this will be a short response.

I care about her because I care about her, I'd do it if she had everything intact, physically and mentally. Of course, if that was the case, we probably wouldn't ever have met, and I wouldn't have given her more than a momentary glace as we passed each other in a mall or something, and would've thought 'Wow, cute kid'.

It's complicated. I know I'll get laughed at for this, but I don't go around fantasizing about junior poopers. She's a special case.

### 17452306

this is a heartwarming tale. however, while i don't claim to know much about adoption procedures, i would think it unlikely that they would allow a young single male to adopt anyone other than family. but i understand that the foster care system etc is pretty fucked up, so i guess you might have a chance just by virtue of them wanting to get rid of her.

sorry, but that fairytale shit just doesn't happen.

### 17452342 (OP) ###

I'd put her odds of winding up in foster care, which I'm sure would be spec-tacular for her, at around 1%. Foster parents don't HAVE to accept any kids, they choose to do so...thus, the really messed up ones rarely ever leave group homes.

...and group homes don't HAVE to accept kids they admit they can't care for. Such as those with severe physical and medical needs, let alone severe mental health issues.

That's where the institutional care comes in...which is where she's at, and where she'll stay unless someone, someone outside the system, persay, steps in and takes a risk.

Frankly, I don't see anyone else stepping up to the plate, so far.

### 17451348

odds are if she had any close family left she wouldn't be stuck in a facilty like this, or maybe they live in another country.

adoption is pretty unlikely, even if its uncontested. having a single guy want to adopt a young girl usually raises some red flags. odds are its straight to a foster home of some kind as soon as she's through with rehab.

### 17452812 (OP) ###

Yeah, I know it's a longshot. But I've seen single parents adopt successfully before. I'm actually a pretty upstanding guy, /b/attle scars aside, and I can actually care for her special needs (no, this is not innuendo), which is a big plus in such a case. I have a steady income already, I have friends and family that'll stand beside me, and yeah, nobody in the system wants her.

Frankly, /b/ is my biggest danger here, but I'm a /b/tard, and a /b/tard I shall be. I'll just have to be careful there.

### 17453007

`>>17452812`

This is a terrible thing to do to /b/, but I suggest that you leave /b/ until the adoption process goes through. That would fucking suck because we all want to hear every day about your wonderful life. But in the end it might be the best.

### 17452855

whatever you do, befriend her. if adoption (by you) proves impossible, still keep in touch and support her. the latter outcome may completely elimnate the possiblity of lolisex, but at least she'll have someone to turn to if life keeps treating her bad.

### 17452965 (OP) ###

`>>17452817`
> This thread will be going overboard soon. What do we do after, wait for the next update, like yesterday?

Well, I don't have anything too pressing this afternoon. I could start another thread and stick around a bit longer if people have further questions. It's not like I spend my off-hours curing cancer or something.

### 17453285

I think you should adopt the loli AND spend your off-hours curing cancer!

### 17452840

OP I hope you remember to suggest getting her a teddy bear at the meeting like you said you were going to. Or just smuggle one in. I hope nobody there has the heart to take a teddybear away from her just because it's against regulations.

### 17453030 (OP) ###

Believe me, I hope so too...the head administrator isn't a COMPLETE bitch, and most of the rest of the nursing staff and orderlies are relatively decent people, you know, for being in a high-burnout profession...I can just keep my fingers crossed, and hope that it either causes no furor, or a small enough one that I'll get off with a slap on the wrist.

### 17453274

    ( ** MOAR LIEK WANNABE)

### 17453402

OP- i don't know if this would be possible, but you might consider organizing some of the other nurses to get something for her (perhaps a christmas gift). it would be a lot less creepy, and if you are clearly the ringleader it would still endear you to her. also it would be a good way to make your concern for her known before trying to adopt her. if gifts that she won't talk about mysteriously appear and then out of the blue you apply to adopt her, people might assume you've been doing other things behind their back too.

### 17454864 (Nurse-Kun) ###

I don't have anything to ask, but I just want to say that your story makes me feel all warm and cozy on the inside, which is truly surprising for /b/.

Good work, Anonynurse, good work.

### 17455471 (Nurse-Kun) ###  

> [Why "anonynurse"? Wasn't it "Nurse Otoko"?]

Well, it was the first thing that sprang to mind, terrible as it was (Anonynurse, that is). I hold neither love nor esteem for it, but while it goes against my Anonymous instincts, I needed something to indicate my identity, such as it is, and OP for the OP seemed rather ludicrous.

I'm not japanese, and don't pretend or try to be, but eh, I'll let 4chan decide.

### 17455476

I think you should be known on /b/ as Nurse-kun and Amputee-chan, since "Anonynurse and the half-japanese loli with no legs, one arm and one eye" takes too long to type.

### 17455500

Ok, serious question. When are you actually going to approach them about adopting? I mean, how long will you keep just doing little things for her, helping her out in the hospital, trying to gain her trust, etc. first?

### 17455537

`>>17455374`

Generally, any ward of the state that's under 18 is available for adoption...not necessarily adoption-likely but one can at least try.

### 17455608

`>>17454864`    
`>>17455374`

If she's up for adoption, I sure would like to try. You and your damned story are too heartwarming. In the words of /b/, "I'm detecting large amounts of win in this thread."

### 17455652 (OP) ###  

I probably wouldn't make a serious inquiry/request until at least the new year, if only because doing it without at least having her half-trust/like me would be both pretty dumb and pretty self-defeating.

### 17455743

`>>17455652`

Yeah, that's what I figured. What are you going to try to accomplish with her in that time? (such as helping her open up, helping her find new hobbies, making friends with her, helping the other staff do the same, etc.)

### 17455711

`>>17455670`
> What exactly do you have to prove to be approved as an adoptive parent?

reasonable doubt that you won't rape and murder the child

### 17455995 (OP) ###  

I'll do what I can. I mean, I really would like to gain her trust, because she doesn't trust anyone right now, and that's probably one of the bigger hindrances to her getting any better. And I'll treat her like I'd treat any other kid in her situation that I was willing to risk my life over...as best I can. It's the only way things will go at all well for anyone involved.

### 17455921

also, OP should never let the adoption authorities know of 4chan.

KEEP IT SECRET. KEEP IT SAFE.

### 17455993

`>>17455921`

I imagine you should hit up /g/ if they demand to check your computer so that you can totally wipe all evidence of 4chan or any other incriminating websites you might have in your cache.

My record is clean. Other than browsing /b/, I've never done anything illegal. I don't even have any CP to hide. Which has made my feelings for her, confused as they are, all the more extra-confusing.

`>>17455776`
> Does the place where you work have any sort of rules against employees adopting current/post-patients? I'd guess not, as you said in the first thread that most people there are old as fuck, but it just seems like that could be an obstacle."

Not that I'm aware of. But if it is a problem, and it's the deal breaker, the choice between success and keeping my job...I can get another job, even in my field. There's a health care crisis on, you know.

### 17456184

Question here. How much time in total have you spent with her? Seems like you've only talked to her a few brief times late at night, while gathering most of your info from her records and other people.

If you do adopt her, you'll be committing yourself to the full reality of her situation. You'll have to care for all her needs, you'll have to deal with all her mental problems like the random outbursts, and you'll also have to deal with the fact that you'd be a single parent with an underaged crippled child. I'm sure people will be talking behind your back, both good and bad.

I have no doubt that you'll be able to provide for the girl, but at the same time, this isn't like taking some stray dog off the street. Adopting her would drastically change your life. If you feel you can take on all the physical, emotional, and financial burden as well as the criticism you may get from other people, all the more power to you man.

### 17456247

To the OP, don't you think that the responsible thing to do - as you have somewhat lustful feelings for this girl - is to avoid becoming her guardian?  
Seems to me to be a really bad idea for both of you.

### 17456259  ###  

Believe me, I am VERY aware of this.  
...which is why I'm still in 'hard thinking' mode, not 'painting the spare room pink' mode.

### 17456471

`>>17456259`

Which is why I'm saying. Meeting her at the late hours of the night may turn on your feelings of wanting to protect and care for her, but if you make her a part of your life, you'll also have to deal with the not so favorable sides of her.

If I was in your shoes, I'd also feel sorry for her as well, but I know for a fact that I'm too much of a selfish asshole. You'd have to sacrifice a lot of her, and I'm sure I wouldn't be able to do that.

### 17456917

It's good to see that you seem to be taking a long look at things before jumping to any decisions. The best thing to do is take things a day at a time, and do what you can to help her out. If you can't adopt, or something else happens, at least maybe the memories of someone treating her nice will help her in the future.

### 17456265

`>>17456175`
> What hospital are you working at?

Come on, man, he can't tell where he works.

### 17456425

Why not? Nobody gives a shit. I'm working as a pathologist assistant here and there is a somewhat similar situation, thought it might be the same girl.

### 17456541

`>>17456425`

People want to fucking kill him because they think he's a pedo.

Revealing personal info on /b/ is like dropping your pants and bending over in a maximum security prison. Some asshole would find a way to report him.

Authorities might not even take it very seriously, but it could still hurt his chances.

### 17456532 (OP) ###

`>>17456707`
> i'd suggest trying to get other workers together on doing things for her. you could be the clear ringleader, but it would be far less creepy and would give everyone context to your request for adoption.

As I mentioned once before, I'm already planning ways to accomplish this. But friday nights, good luck finding anyone still around at 10 pm, and on the weekends, during the day? I'll schedule a meeting come monday, and present my proposal. We are allowed to make recommendations for the consideration of the treatment of patients; like I said, the head administrator isn't a COMPLETE bitch.

#### 17462640

`>>17462332`

It's called the /b/ filter. This is an instance of how it works.

Anon: I see a black man sitting at the bus stop.  
/b/ filter  
Anon: OH LAWD HE'S A GOIN' TO KFC FOR SUM CHICKEN

This is just like that.

Anon: I see this cute, strong, and unfortunate little girl. I admire her greatly, and wish to help her.  
/b/ filter:  
Anon: STICK IT IN LOLI POOPER FOR WIN

#### 17456725

I'm no longer worried about the OP raping her.

He shows a degree of judgement too far beyond that of a pedophile. He shows that he has a conscience that would not allow him to do this.

If any of you still doubt this, just keep in mind that this is the kind of man who would regret doing this for the rest of his life.

#### 17457681

`>>17457560`
> For the record, I think it's a terrible idea to even consider adopting someone you have lustful feelings for at any level. Caring for a girl in this situation full-time is hardly going to be easy and if the deicision to adopt is based on clouded judgement there's real potential for disaster.

As a father and a paedophile I can happily inform you that your opinion is null and void. Just because you want to bone a chick who is in your care doesn't mean you can't take good care of her.

#### 17457798

`>>17457681`

Since when did one case = the norm? Just because you haven't fucked up your relationship with your daughter, doesn't mean the OP won't.

Consider also that a single-parent adopting a crippled girl is a considerably different situation to a paedophile assumedly in a relationship caring for his daughter.

#### 17457842

`>>17457798`

So no one should ever have children or adopt or in fact do anything because they might fuck it up.

#### 17457892

it always makes me shudder to hear of /b/tards breeding. but i suppose it can't be helped

#### 17456897
`>>17456793`

OP is a fucking nigger pedophile who should kill himself. All the faggots that support him should die too.

P.S. This entire thread is fake. But it sure makes me mad.

#### 17456827 + 17457930

`>>17456725`

Playing devil's advocate here, you seem to be working under the false assumptions that:

A: A paedophile is an inhuman monster who doesn't hold any degree of social normality and thus is easy to spot.   
B: The OP is telling the 100% truth and not making the entire thing up or changing details or lying about his feelings to make himself look better.

If you've spent any time on /b/ you'd know better than to jump to the conclusion "Dudes! This guy isn't a pedo! I can tell from the words he has typed on an Internet forum!".

I think it's going to be pretty important for the people here to research the difference between the following labels for future reference:

* Pedophile
* Ephebophile
* Sex offender
* Sexual Predator
* Violent Sexual Predator

### 17457069

Remember if this story is true, it is being viewed through the OP's eyes. Imagine how much mental masturbation may have happend in his head and has perceived everything happy happy

#### 17457215

`>>17457069`

Exactly. Everyone here has been jumping to conclusions: Either the OP is the lowest form of scum on Earth, a terrible, monstrous pedophile, or he's a gleaming golden god, upholding justice and truth in a messed up world.

I would expect /b/tards to be much more sceptical that this.

#### 17457426

The world isn't black or white, it's all shades of grey. There's no real saints out there, but trying to crucify the guy because of some /b/ style comments is just absurd.

I'm a fairly normal guy, but I also browse /b/ and I'll type things that I'd never say or realisticly think of doing in real life.

I'm not saying he's the Second Coming, but these assholes proclaiming he should instantly be sodomized in a maximum security prison are a fucking joke.

#### 17457414 (OP) ###  

`>>17457215`

I'm no saint.

I'm not taken to wearing dirty trenchcoats and luring children into my white van with candy, either.

The world is full of shit, you can either do your best to tread it, or start eating.

### 17457594

To OP:

I am somewhat confused about your intents. I am pretty sure it is either of the following:

1. Gain her trust, adopt her, care for her, be sexually open toward her and eventually, when appropriate, if she consents, stick it in, or

2. Gain her trust, adopt her, care for her, completely avoid any sexual activity with her forever.

You seem to not want to do anything to hurt her, but if you educate her, and she consents, and she trusts you, since you really seem to care for her, what would the problem be?

Many people here seem to think you are leaning toward one of two extremes: completely avoiding sex or outright coldheartedly raping her to death.

### 17457910 (OP) ###  

I don't have a long-term master plan in place, despite what some may think. I'm basically trying to figure out what my heart, (as faggoty and retarded as that sounds), is telling me I should do.

I wouldn't consider something of this magnitude without being ready for the consequences... *the first thread was as much a subconcious attempt at getting people to tell me to just walk away entirely as anything...* guess it failed.

There is no coldhearted raping in the forecast. And yes, I am quite aware that any sex with an immature person is rape, 'consenting' or not...and I'm not a fucking rationalizing pedo that'd say 'oh, children can be totally mature as any adult, man...'

I didn't go looking for this situation. Fuck.

### 17458080

Some people in this thread have already told you that adopting her is an awful idea. You may want to take that advice to heart.

I suspect you haven't because you don't want to just "give up" on this girl, because you think that would be heartless. Really though, the best thing for her is probably to do exactly that, even if it makes you feel like shit.

### 17458225 + 17458941

Nurse-kun, you should keep trying to befriend her and help her open up, but other than that, just wait.

If the time comes and she still doesn't have anyone who wants to take her in, then you should consider it. But it's far too premature at this point.

This isn't some sort of quick fix for your conscience and your natural protective feelings. This will be a lifetime commitment.

You will have to devote the rest of your life to her health and well being. You will have to be able to protect her form all the people out there that would want to take advantage of her and try to hurt her, just because she is weak.

At the same time, you will have to give her enough leeway to grow and develop independance, so she will be able to function in society without you having to be there at all times to serve as a buffer from reality.

This will take an epic amount of patience, compassion, understanding, and a good sense of humor.

I want this to work, I want you to be all these things and come out of this as the kind of person everyone wishes they could be.

Your story actually made me think about what I'm doing to help people around me that I see in the paper. I have money and time, and I've done nothing in my thirty years to be a good man. Don't let us down, and don't let this girl down. If you are going to give her any hope, be ready to follow through.

### 17458410

`>>17458225`

This is true. Right now, she just thinks you are the nice nurse. It is going to take a long time for her to ever WANT to be adopted by you.

### 17462904 (OP) ###  

`>>17462224`
> OP, I think you should find her a good home, but not with you. No offense, you seem very nice, but how can you trust yourself not to raep your adopted daughter?

Well, to be fair, I haven't raped anyone else so far. Perfect record!

God, you people go on and on and on, and this thread is getting pretty damned boring. But hey, keep jerking it to your impotent thoughts of rage at the monster DARING to give a shit about that poor, poor little girl, that you'd tsk and 'aww' over if you ever saw her, but you'd start feeling uncomfortable with and want to get away from as soon as you could, just like everyone else that hasn't been paid to deal with her thus far have.

She had friends before the accident, you know. She and her parents both. They all came to visit her in the hospital afterward...

...once. None of them ever came back for a second visit. You fags make me sick, with your furious mewlings. Save that virility for your glory holes and GTFO, dramafags.

you might consider a different op pic next time. the naked amputee loli was apropos and good for attracting attention to your first post, but it does have a tendency to color everything you say. perhaps find a less erotic one for your next thread, and then post another thread with the loli and a link to the actual one.

### 17460770

OP, keep starting the thread with that amputee loli. If some faggots get their panties in a twist over that and the very first post that you made, I say fuck them.

Besides, that pic is cute. <3

### 17461210 (OP)

I chose the OP picture because it was eyecatching, and, well, pretty close to her situation, disturbingly enough (she doesn't have such extensive scarring on her leg-stumps, and her right arm's is a much 'longer' trans-tibial amputation, rather than a disarticulation). I'm not sure if I should change it, since it's a reasonably good way to suggest that it's a genuine thread about her, though I guess that's easily enough faked. I'll think about it.

I hadn't thought it was very indicative of raep, what with the lack of cocks, or mysterious white fluids, or any sort of a 'come-hither' look or position on the picture-character's part. I'd considered censoring the naughty bits, but this is /b/, and, like I said above, it's eyecatching.

### 17460846

OP, how about starting to post threads with a pic that is less...indicative of loli raep?

The disfigured loli is somewhat unsettling, and distracting from your message.

This thread reminds me of this.

WHO WOULD YOU CHOOSE /B/?

### /i/ 44658

Wow.

Uh, I'm not sure exactly what to say, but I suppose I can at least give you a fair description of her.

She's seven years old, scandanavian father, japanese mother. I'm not a geneticist, so I don't know the odds, but she wound up with blonde hair, somewhere between ash and honey, I'd say, and green eyes. She also wound up with a skintone somewhere between his (I'm guessing) pale fjordish and her (also guessing) pale japanese. Her features are predominantly still japanese in configuration, with minor caucasian/fjordish bits here and there: She tends toward the EXTREMELY cute variety of japnese-ish girl features, however, petite and 'idol' worthy. She's beautiful, by any standard.

She was a physically active girl before the accident, involved in both general athletics and gymnastics, it seems...probably the main reason she's doing so well with her rehab. She's rather petite, average-little-japanese-girl sized, but not tiny. No particularly special innate physical characteristics from the neck down.

### /i/ 44665

_Continuation from the thread in /i/ described above_  
Her right arm was amputated trans-tibially (through the upper arm), about four inches below the shoulder. Both her legs are trans-femur amputations (through the thigh), roughly halfway down. She doesn't have Bikko-style hypertrophic scarring at any of these locations, though the injuries only occured roughly three months ago, so they're still quite new, and still healing completely.

She's learning to walk again with a pair of prosthetic legs; these include artificial knees (hydraulic models, I think), and she uses silicone sheathes that then hold the sockets in place via suction. Her prosthetic right arm is a mixture of cosmetic and functional, with a myolectric hand and bodypowered elbow; it's also held in place via suction between the socket and the stump.  
Her right eye was lost, and has since been fitted with a prosthetic orb and a cosmetic 'glass eye' that looks quite a bit like her real one, though you can tell up close. There was some scarring over her eyelids and above and below the socket, since the eye was lost via a chunk of shrapnel in the accident, and it tore up the surroundings somewhat, too. Not as large as the first picture in the thread, but noticible.

She wears relatively simple sets of clothing...gowns, housecoats, etc. Shit, almost forgot: Her hair is somewhat short all-round, the original picture in this thread is actually not that far off...she hasn't been wearing it up in ribbons or barrettes or such much, since she doesn't like people helping her with it, and she can only do so much by herself.  
Not entirely sure what I think about all this, but if people feel the need, who am I to object?

### /i/ 44677

Frankly, all my information about her parents is secondhand gossip from the hospital, and a bit from her records. It hardly included a family tree, or even pictures of what her parents actually looked like.

### 17465306

OP here. I honestly have no problem with a clothed version. If I had the photoshopping skills, I would've done it myself. Anonymous isn't my personal army, though, if someone feels like doing so, it's good, if not, I can manage some black censor bars or something.

(To the edit below): Well, that would be the final distinguishing touch, all right. The hair is actually pretty damn close...good work there.

### /i/ 44766

> _PROTIP: the tibia is a bone in the lower leg. The right word for an amputation through the upper arm is transhumeral. I doubt the OP is a genuine registered nurse, he'd know at least this much._

Fuck, this is why you don't drink and post, as lame and undoubtedly made-up as that sounds.

Guess it's a good thing I didn't go for med school after all. Anyway, need to head in to the 'office' in time for the nurses' lunchtime gathering, to bounce my idea off them before I take it to the administration office.

<a id="chapter3"></a>
## Part 3 (December 18th)  ##

### 17505569

Hey, /b/. Sorry to be later than usual, but there's a reason for it.  
I got up early, and headed into the 'office' around ten thirty, then into the staff room. The nurses usually eat lunch together around eleven, before the patients' lunchtime, since it's such an ordeal to get them all to eat, and then to clean up the mess they make. I hung out in there, chatting with various people as everyone began to filter in. I usually work the night shift, but we all swap shifts sometimes as needed, and since I'm single and young, I wind up accepting requests more often than most; thus, they all know me, even if I'm not as common a fixture as most, at this time of day.  
I got to the point, admitting that I'd given her the mini-bear, saying I'd left it in her room while she was asleep. I also admitted that I knew it wasn't exactly orthodox procedure, but explained that I'd felt badly for her, when I saw her during my duties, and wanted to do something nice for her.  
Then I asked if any of them had noticed her with it, and if so, what she seemed to think of it; I got several responses, including the nurse in charge of her during the day, a middle-aged woman that'd been here for at least ten years: apparently, she hadn't been seen *without* it since she was checked upon on sunday morning. She hadn't said anything about where she'd gotten it, in her usual tacitrun manner, but it seemed pretty clear that she liked it.

### 17505871

Relieved to hear this, I then asked how the rest of them felt about her, saying that it seemed wrong to just let her fade away in here, that she reminded me of my niece (she does, a little, though my niece is several years older, and perfectly all right physically and mentally and home-lifeally), and what they thought about giving her a few more little presents from 'the staff', that I'd be happy to pay for them, but would they back me on this?  
There was some discussion on this, of course, because as I've already mentioned, there are certain behaviours and familiarities that can be a bit taboo. I pointed out that nobody minded when we were friendly and kind to our elderly parents...that their children actually appreciated it greatly, that it was viewed as a good thing. Should we wind up treating her harmfully, particularly considering her mental and social fragility, just to avoid making waves? (I'm paraphrasing the discussions here, obviously)  
After further discussion, everyone finally agreed that they'd back me up, so long as I brought the issue to the head administrator and got her permission. I suppose it was the best I could've hoped for, and I'd been thinking I may have to do that anyway, so it went well, all things told.

### 17506206

The administrator always eats outside of the facility come lunchtime, chalking it up as 'business expenses' because she brings a few reports to page through, so I would have to wait until at least one, probably one-thirty, to see her.  
Since that was the case, I decided to take care of something else I'd been thinking about, first, and went to see our resident headshrinker. She's a nice, if somewhat bland, woman in her mid-thirties, and I found her in her office, eating lunch at her desk. I apologized for disturbing her, then asked if she minded my picking her brain a little.  
I told her about how I had been taking care of my little patient, and asked for her advice on how I should be dealing with her, what I should be careful about, and whether my being friendly toward her would do more good or harm.  
While I'd known that she had trouble sleeping, I learned the extent of it, and I was somewhat surprised...apparently, she's been having recurring nightmares since the accident, which is a pretty common symptom/effect of PTSD, particularly in children. She hadn't called me after any such events, so I could only imagine how she was dealing with them...it was painful to think about.  
Her general advice was that it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing to be friendly when I dealt with her, within common-sense limits, of course, and that offering to be 'there for her', so to speak, might actually be helpful.  
In any case, the meeting went pretty well, and she commended me on my concern for her, before I left.

### 17506518

I killed time until half-past one, when I went to the CA's office, and asked to speak with her regarding a patient. Her secretary had me wait for about ten minutes, pretty typical way staff gets treated when they try to talk with her, then I headed in.  
I came clean, more or less, giving the version of events I gave the other nurses to her, and offering the same proposal of an increase in 'niceness' and giftage toward the patient, being sure to include that the other nurses thought it was a good idea, and were behind me on it; in addition, I brought up our psychiatrist's thinking it might be a good idea, in her professional opinion.  
She frowned, and hemmed, and hawed; she's enjoys what power she has, even if she doesn't quite qualify as a 'tyrant', and clearly wasn't terribly pleased at my initiative. But, luckily for me, for whatever her precise reason, she refrained from punishment, and said that she'd consider my proposal, saying she'd need to speak to our legal counsel about it. I said that I understood, and agreed that I'd 'be careful' in the meantime. Whew. It was a pretty busy morning, but a pretty good one, I think...as good as it could've gone, anyway.  
I'm just glad she likes it.

### 17506731

Sheesh. I'm typing this all out by hand, you know, folks, I'm not copypasting it from a copy written in one chunk ahead of time. Thus, the space between posts, despite it being the singular initial report.  
In the meantime, a billion comments and questions inbetween. Might take me a bit to catch up with them, sorry. Be patient with me.

### 17506825

> _re: "While she likes the teddy bear, she might not understand your intentions fully." etc._

Yes, I know that. I discussed that with our shrink, and she said I definitely needed to tell her that, yes, this was a special treatment meant just for her. She also said that this wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, since it would help her feel, and understand, that she's cared about individually, not just as 'another patient'.  
Of course, I'll probably be splitting any gift-credit with the rest of the staff, and at the same time, offering to be there if she needs me, wants to talk, etc, individually. I'm trying to do this in a somewhat transparent manner...

### 17506970

> _re: "Anonynurse, if you DO adopt her, you can more or less kiss your current job goodbye. Taking care of an invalid, especially a young invalid, is a very time-intensive task for one person. It's also VERY expensive. Unless you have a very large amount of money and can afford to take a few years off work, it probably won't work out."_

This is a serious point, and I want to address it.  
Believe me, I know. If it does happen, she's going to require full-time care, at least for the foreseeable future. I wouldn't just be a parent, I'd be a fulltime homecare nurse. Fortunately, I'm more qualified for that burden than any non-professional parent could be, though I will admit that I've probably never faced as stressful a situation as that before.  
Someone in her situation, when adopted, comes with a compensation payment to help cover their medical costs...which should help somewhat. As her legal ward, I'd also be responsible for her 'assets', including the remainder of the life insurance from her parents, which would be a helpful backup fund for covering expenses.  
Finally, if it did happen, my family will probably help me out as well, they're good people, so...it could probably work out...financially, anyway. Hopefully.

### 17507759

Sigh. Fine, you want to know one of the reasons I haven't given ANY pictures yet?  
I don't have a camera in my cellphone, since I don't use it much, and it's over a year old. I don't have a webcam, because I'm not a fucking camwhore. I don't have a digital camera, because I rarely need, or want, to take pictures. If I do produce photographic evidence, it won't be appearing today, that much is certain.  
Maybe I'll look into a cheap form of one of those items, but it isn't on the agenda for the immediate future. I'm not looking for /b/points, and I don't really even care THAT much if any of you believe me, so, hey, whatever.

### 17508405

Ok, ok. I didn't think it was THAT bad, considering it's /b/, but I have no particular attachment to it. It was just a way to identify that it was me, from the first thread on.  
Starting next thread: New Picture.

### 17508642

Uh, yes, I said I had *sunday's shift off*. You know, when I would've been working from 10pm to 6am, like I usually do? And I didn't work last night, since, uh, I didn't have a shift scheduled.  
And, as I mentioned in my first post today, I went in there ON MY OWN TIME...I will be going in TO WORK, tonight, at 10 pm, as usual.  
Thanks for the orange, again, you're welcome to believe or not believe, read or not, as you wish. This is /b/. I'm not getting or losing anything by your doing so or not either way.

_When /b/ gives a relatively positive response to someones actions or intentions, people tend to act quicker than normal. (note to the OP: Congrats, but don't rush things too quickly. You probably already know this, but I doubt this little girl, who just had her life flipped upside down, would appreciate any other drastic changes.) Also, even though the OP may seem to have progressed quickly from our perspective, this isn't necessarily true. The OP is describing each minor detail to us, which has piled up to quite a bit of information over his collective posts. However, what has actually occured throughout this time is miniscule. In summary, the only thing he has done besides his job, is give a little lonely girl a small gift despite it being kinda against the hospital's rules and then chat about it with his co-workers. This seems perfectly believable to me, and even if it is fake, its not like lying on 4chan is exactly frowned upon._

You know, this guy is right. I mean, it's not like this is proceeding at the pace of an H-game or something.__

As I've already said in response to another post, if it goes through, I'd likely be at home full-time. There are financial options in place to make this doable.  
I've thought about how a girlfriend might work if it happened, as well...despite this being /b/, I have had them in the past, and I haven't had a tremendous amount of trouble getting/keeping them, the vaguaries of youth nothwithstanding. Still, while you might think that being such a nurturing-looking person by taking care of her, women are human beings too, and people like her are hard for human beings to deal with, even in such a peripheral and minor role of a girlfriend. I couldn't ask one to take care of her.  
And, um, I...well, it's complicated. All I know for sure is that I don't want to hurt her.

### 17509447

> _registered nurse vs. nurse orderly_

Well, I kinda do both jobs, since I'm alone at night, and have to deal with a number of senile or otherwise mentally compromised and occasionally troublesome patients. It was just a layman shorthand of a general job description.  
I am, in fact, a registered nurse. YES, A REGISTERED MALE NURSE. PLZ DO NOT DRAW ME IN CAP WHITE'S OUTFIT W/GIANT NEEDLE.

### 17510719+17511021

> _re: "OBJECTION!" and poorly written phoenix wright dialogue. It was very well written you piece of shit(/B/tard)._

Your lack of knowledge cannot be disguised with bombastity alone. Clearly, while you believe you've spotted some sort of giant gaping hole (much like you are no doubt picturing at the end of her stumps) in my account, all that you've seen is an ignorant fool's picture in your own mind.  
The average time it takes to heal to the point of entirely closed flesh after amputation is under a month, with variations based upon age, general health, and all the other things that determine how fast one heals any other cut or incision. When this initial healing is completed, and all sutures and staples removed, the result is a thin but coherent scar tissue joining the flesh that was knit together during the surgery. While it is 'healed', it remains fragile, and can be worried open again, thus necessitating careful treatment.  
HOWEVER! Her legs had suffered serious burns, which was the main reason for the choice to amputate. While the point to amputate at was chosen at a site above the limit of the burns, the additional trauma caused via nerve damage by these burns has left her in considerable pain even after this 'healing' has occured.  
Furthermore, it is common practice in amputation cases that have been pre-scheduled with some measure of time available beforehand to have a very basic prosthetic limb ready and 'fitted' onto the stump when the patient awakens post-surgery, to help with accepting it psychologically. I find it hard to believe that any medical professional would allow such a thing to happen if even a freshly-amputated and sutured limb being 'capped' would harm the patient!  
Her arm was not burned, and would thus be considered 'fully' healed, as much as any amputation site could be, and she has thus apparently being doing quite well with learning to use that prosthetic limb. On the other hand, since her leg stumps still cause her frequent pain, which will hopefully fade with time, they cannot be considered, by a medical professional, to be 'fully' healed, despite the skin and muscle tissue having healed well enough to begin prosthetic rehab!  
Such rehab consisting largely, at this point, of her learning to balance upon her new legs, particularly without natural knees, the most crucial component in the human legs for the act of walking. She is never unassisted by a rehabilitation professional in these attempts, and would still fall over if she tried to do so on her own. Even if she is learning very quickly as compared to a 'standard' person in her situation, she is nowhere close to walking unassisted yet!  
You should really hire an expert to brief yourself in these matters before launching into an attack, and please keep your RP faggotry in its own threads, TYVM, and GTFO!

### 17511537

>  _In response to "Would you show her the fanart [/b/](//b/) has drawn?_

I've considered it, actually...it was such an idea that first inspired me to suggest people draw such fanart, though clearly, it's a bit of a sticky subject...because if I show it to her, even if she likes it, and it makes her feel better, I'd probably need to ask her to keep it a secret. Because other people learning that I gave descriptions of her to people to draw pictures of her on the internets would self-evidently, for anyone with half a brain, be a serious no-no.  
Even if I tell her that people learned about her on their own and drew it on their own, it's still risky, because people learning I found it and directed it to her would likely trace it back here somehow, and, well.  
I'm still thinking about it.

### 17511894

Well, yes, but this is /b/. I figured a less emotionally-charged reasoning would be more acceptable to the full audience. But yes, I certainly hadn't planned on throwing a handful of printouts at her any time soon.

Um, that's the plan. I'm not sure if I should do anything tonight, though I'm considering checking to see if she's awake, and if so, telling her that she doesn't have to keep the bear a secret, etc, just to take that burden off her.

## Part 4 (December 19th)


### 17555176

Hey, /b/. It was a pretty big night, so I wound up oversleeping a bit. Anyway, here we go.  
I headed into work a bit earlier than usual, nothing too special, really, but headed for the staff break room and killed time there. I spoke with a few coworkers about what'd gone down earlier in the day, in my speaking with the morning/day staff, and mostly got some support from the later-working nurses for my ideas. It was nice, reminding me that, even as overworked as we are, and as difficult as our patients can be, we do care about them, on the whole, as much as we can while staying sane, anyway.  
I headed for my station when the time came, nothing too special there, and waited until about 1:15 before I headed for her room. I knocked gently on her door, quietly enough that I wouldn't wake her if she was asleep, but loudly enough that she'd notice if she wasn't...and, it turns out, the latter was the case, as I heard a quiet "What?" after a few second's pause. I opened the door and asked if it was all right if I came inside, and after another short hesitation, she nodded to me.  
I moved over to her bedside, nabbing the room's sole chair on the way and taking a seat upon it, trying to maintain a safe, but not too exclusive, distance from her, not quite close enough to reach out and touch her. She was staring at me, waiting to see what I wanted, and I offered her a casual, but genuine, smile.

### 17555688

I said, first, that I was glad that she liked my gift, noting that the mini-bear was actually sitting on the bed at her side, between her body and the wall. She didn't say anything, just looked down a bit, perhaps in a partial nod; I then took a small breath...and told her I was sorry. That I shouldn't have asked her to keep it secret, and that I'd told everyone that I gave it to her, so she didn't have to worry about that anymore. I then told her that the other nurses and I were making a list for santa, and she should think about a list of what might be nice to get for christmas.  
She...it's hard to put into words, but she looked like an older kid being told something about santa, who plays along to humor a loved one, even though they don't really believe in him anymore. She didn't laugh it off, or make a joke, but just looked up at me...and nodded again, slowly, saying "Okay." quietly. I felt bad, but tried not to let it show, and forged ahead.  
I told her that if she ever wanted to talk about anything, or tell someone something, or ask for anything, that she could call me. That I would be happy to help, trying not to phrase it along the lines of 'it's my job', since it was clear she only thought anyone was doing anything for her for that reason. She looked down again at that...and didn't say anything, or nod, or anything. It was discomforting, but I had to be understanding, and just smiled again, and said I'd be there if she needed anything, again, and said I'd let her get some sleep. Then I got up, moved the chair back, and moved to leave the room, leaving her alone again.

### 17556199

Not much happened for a while, then. I killed time as usual, reading through the day's updates on conditions, playing my DS and reading a new book I'd picked up earlier, answering a call from a man in his 90s that suffers from severe arthritis that sometimes makes sleeping hard around 3:30, and providing him some painkillers and a sleep aid, and helping him get comfortable in the meantime. Nothing too special, really...except for what happened when I was on my way back to my station after I finished taking care of him.  
I was passing by her room...and I heard something. The doors are rather thin, a quirk of cheap construction, and as I paused, and moved my ear closer to hers, I could start to make out...crying. I hesitated...she hadn't called for me, I would've gotten a signal from my pager, on my belt, if she had; maybe she didn't want my attention, maybe she didn't want anything. This could go badly. But I had already made a decision, one I'd informed her of just a few hours earlier. A decision not to just sit by and do nothing...a decision that I wanted to try and help her.  
I opened her door.

### 17556758

She was on her right side in her bed, facing the wall, with her hand up near her face, though I couldn't see exactly what was happening there, clearly. She was making...well, the sounds a child crying, but trying to both stop crying and to keep anyone else from noticing, makes; a painful sound, whimpers and sobs choked by tears...I was almost paralyzed at the door, not sure what to do...she hadn't reacted to me yet, perhaps not having heard me.  
Then I made out a word amidst the sounds, and it broke my heart worse than anything else ever had, which took a lot. "Mom...mom..."...she was whispering it, with a mixture of need and hopelessness that...it just...it hurt to hear almost as much as it was clearly hurting her to say.  
I couldn't hold back anymore at that, stepping closer, slowly, and gently saying her name to get her attention and announce my presence. She started noticibly at that announcement, her body tensing as she curled up tighter and turned her face further away from me, almost grinding it into her pillow, telling me, in a wet voice, fortunately not quite loud enough to likely wake her neighbours, to go away, and leave her alone. I frowned in a bit of frustration, considering whether that would be a wise thing to do, then firmed my resolve, and stepped up to the side of her bed. I said her name again, quietly, gently, not reaching out yet, still hesitant about going too far, and finding no words appropriate for this situation, I didn't say anything else, and could just move to kneel there, watching her painfully.

### 17557550

This went on for another couple of minutes, almost, but it seemed a lot longer...until it finally became too much, and I reached out to, carefully, rest my right hand on her left shoulder, which was still shaking as she seemed to be trying to clamp down on herself, so to speak; I said her name again...and I told her...it'd be ok, that she wasn't alone...taking a guess from my discussion with the resident shrink yesterday, I told her that bad dreams can't hurt us if we wake up and let the light chase them away, similar advice I'd given my little brother once, though it seemed weak for this situation.  
She started crying again after I said that, and I was worried I'd just made things worse, when she moved to grab my hand and rolled over to face me, her face soaked with tears, and in such pain...she looked up at me for just a half-second, then clenched her eyes shut and started sobbing brokenly, what was left of her entire body shaking. My heart started to ache even worse than it had just a moment earlier, and...I did what came naturally, despite all my thoughts and worries about consequences...I leaned in and wrapped my free arm around her loosely, just holding her.

### 17558183

(I'm sorry this is taking so long, but it's a bit hard to write, as it's bringing back still-fresh memories of the event, and, well, I'm an emotions-fag I guess, I know, I know, GTFO, etc)  
We stayed that way, more or less, for what was at least a few minutes, although I hadn't checked my watch ahead of time, and couldn't be sure...slowly, she started to calm down, and the sobs began to lessen, as did the trembling in her small form, just how small, all in all, as even my prior up-close experiences hadn't really made evident to me. Finally, she was quiet, save for an occasional sniffling, and I drew back carefully...I wasn't sure exactly what was going to happen, but flinching away as if something bad had just happened didn't seem like a good idea at all, for either of us. I looked down at her, her face a mess, my scrubs wet where it'd been pressed, and offered a very small, what I hoped was understanding without being amused, smile, and said, again, that it'd be okay, not knowing what else to say.  
I reached, with some contortions considering she was still holding onto my right hand, and it was on my right, over to drag the kleenex box from her bedside table over to an easier usage distance, and started to gently dry her face off, wiping her nose and helping her blow it, and generally just cleaning her up a bit...she stayed quiet through the whole process, keeping her eyes averted from mine, but not turning away...and holding onto my hand with her own the whole time, too.

### 17559326

Fucking fuck fuck fuck fuck. Quick Reply ate my final post. Rewriting...sorry...

### 17559704

I brushed her hair back to some semblance of non-mussedness with my free hand, carefully, and tucked her back in, drawing her rumpled sheets back up over her, adjusting her pillow as best I could. She looked up at me as I was doing this, then, just watching me, whatever she was feeling too hard for me, at least, to read.  
And then I just remained kneeling where I was, and stayed next to her, trying to keep smiling in a reassuring and gentle manner despite my own worked up feelings. She continued watching me, quietly, her small hand squeezing my own all the while...until, after a few minutes, her eyes slowly drooped shut, and she began to relax further...and a few minutes later, she was asleep again. I waited a few more minutes, not wanting to wake her, before carefully extricating my hand from her grasp...I reached over her and found the mini-bear under her pillow, near the wall, and slipped it into her curled fingers in my place. Then I stood, again carefully, and quietly, left the room...

### 17559866

I walked back to my station shakily, and the rest of my shift passed mercifully quietly...I wrote up a report of what'd happened, trying to keep it as professional as I could. To paraphrase: 'Patient had difficulty sleeping due to nightmare, helped them calm down and get back to sleep'. I'd written up similar reports more times than I can count for my other, elderly, patients, so I wasn't making things up...and I refuse to believe I did anything wrong. I guess I can only wait and see what comes next, though...anyway, I was wrung out by the time I got home in the morning and dropped into bed, which, combined with my getting up early on monday, left me sleeping late today. Anyway, that's it for last night, /b/...sorry this took so long.

### 17560304

Just for the record, I'm not so confident she's 'trusting' me entirely yet...but I hope this can help. I'm just glad, at this point, that it went 'well' rather than 'not well'...it's still pretty fresh for me, I'm still thinking about it all...like how she might've gone through a similar situation so many times before this one, with nobody there for any of them to try and comfort her, all alone...it's...pretty overwhelming.

I just told her she didn't HAVE to keep it a secret, and I didn't say I'd be reporting everything I did...whether she wants to keep secrets will be up to her.

> _Please don't let this beautiful girl turn down this path. Please be there for her._

This is one of my bigger concerns in how I relate with and treat her...she does need help with some things, but I'm going to try to let her do what she wants to try and do on her own. I don't control her rehab, of course, or any of the other nurses, but I may speak with them about it if she and I discuss the matter at some point. Since, judging from what I'm hearing about how hard she's working at her physical rehab, she clearly wants to regain at least some of her physical 'freedom', such as it may be...

### 17562612

Something to consider for the longer term._

It's something I've considered, certainly. I'm not at the point where she's really wanted me to keep her company or play with her, so...future, yeah.

### 17562834

> _OP is a faketyfakefakefakeyfake. Posts are too well written for a failure of a registered nurse._

You know, despite making jokes about it at times myself, it's comments like this that piss me off sometimes. It's bad enough that the vast majority of doctors treat us like drooling retards, but the general disrespect from laymen that've seen an episode of ER and think we're barely qualified to change a bandaid makes me want to stab them.  
Then suture there.  
People say there's a doctor shortage (and there is, admittedly), but they have no idea how thinly stretched and dangerous the medical system is in some places simply due to not having enough skilled nurses. And why? Because when you're a nurse, you have to deal with this whole 'so, why didn't you become a doctor?'.

### 17562949

### 17564078

> _Nurse-Kun, Do amputees eat less?_

As 17563422 has said, there isn't much difference in how much an amputee eats. Part of this is that, for lower-limb amputees, they expend considerably more energy to get around on prosthetic limbs than an 'able-bodied' person does (I hope that term doesn't offend our trans-femoral/trans-tibial friend, but a proper set of terms is still in debate, and I'm not really an expert in this area, despite having done some extra research because of her), because their remaining original body parts have to work harder to 'power' the artificial ones. Prosthetics still have a long way to go before they'll be close to being as efficient as natural parts, though there are good people working on it, thankfully.  
As a tidbit: A double above-knee amputee walking on prosthetic legs expends between 300 and 400 percent more energy to get around than an 'able-bodied' person does. And that's on a flat plane. Think about that. The fact that she's even trying to learn to walk again speaks huge volumes about her courage, and makes me admire her all the more...

## Part 5 (December 20th)


### 17606714

Hey /b/. Since the people that seem interested in this haven't told me to stop yet, I'll give it at least one more go. Suppose today's reaction will help determine just where, or if, I'll go with it in the future.   
Last night wasn't too special in setup, got to work, didn't get any flak for the incident on monday night, got to my station and reviewed the patient updates. It seems that she had a relatively 'good' day, in terms of receptivity to treatment, working at her rehab even more vigorously than usual, arguing when she was told it was time to stop for the day...and she hadn't given the other nurses quite as hard a time as she usually did...maybe my telling her about their wish to be 'nicer' to her (paraphrasing)...well, who knows what caused what, really? I debated whether to go over and apologize for checking in on her without being called, but ultimately decided that it could wait for the next time she did, in fact, call me.

### 17606729

Time passed more or less uneventfully, though I did have to deal with a couple of unruly patients. One woman in her 70s that had a stroke a few years back and is paralyzed on her left side, usually pleasent enough, but prone to getting very frustrated at times when she can't do something despite working at it, and, I think, a general unhappiness at being relegated to this home since her husband died...her kids visited her during the day, so I'll let you take a guess at why she was agitated and upset, and couldn't sleep. The other, a woman in her 80s suffering from dementia, was convinced that she'd just fallen asleep in the meeting room a few minutes ago, and we'd 'taken her too soon!', that her family was still out there, waiting for her. It took me a good half hour to calm her down and get her back to sleep, and to change her diaper in the meantime. I just love my job, some days...

### 17606751

It was around four when I got a call from her room...I hurried right over, stepping inside and finding her hunched over in a sitting position in her bed, her good arm holding her abdomen, and sobbing, eyes clenched shut tightly...she opened them and looked up when I came in, looking my way...then looking down and closing them again when I quickly made my way to her bedside, kneeling there and resting my right hand on the bed beside her, close enough to reach out for if she wanted to, but not reaching out myself just yet.   
I asked her, as gently as I could, if she'd had another bad dream...and she nodded, offering a broken-up 'yes' in between the sobs. Not feeling that much better than I had the day before, I suppose my hesitation was dwarfed by what I was feeling for her, and lifted my hand from the bed, and laid it on her back, gingerly, murmering soothing words as best I could; I do admit that I'm not very experienced in this sort of thing, having just tried to comfort a few nieces and nephews, little brothers, rather than kids in a professional situation...but I could only do my best, rather than nothing.

### 17606769

She remained in the position she'd been in for a moment or two longer, then shifted her body to face me more directly, and reached out to grasp at my scrubs, leaning in and crying against me, more muffledly now. After a moment's adjustment to this, I sighed quietly and moved to hug her a bit more tightly; still a loose grasp, to any outside observer, but more closely than just a hand on her back. I continued murmering as soothingly as I could, and shifted a hand up to stroke her hair lightly...it'd seemed to be helpful when my niece fell off her bike a couple summers back...and, well, it didn't seem to cause a bad reaction, at least.   
It was several minutes before she started to calm down again, finally settling into quiet sniffling and trembling; I drew back after she'd relaxed a bit further, though she didn't let go of my scrubs, hanging on near the hemline. Maintaining contact with a hand on her shoulder, I reached out and fetched the kleenex, then helped clean her up again, while trying to maintain a reassuring smile...I asked if she felt better, and while she hesitated slightly in answering that, she finally nodded and told me that she did 'a little bit'. Well, a start, at least...

### 17606781

I helped her lay down again, drawing her sheets and blanket up over her again, fluffing her pillows...finding the minibear wedged into the corner at the wall, and setting it at her side. I asked her if her stomach was all right, and she said it hurt...when I asked, she said that it'd only hurt since she woke up...that it had happened when she felt...bad...'since she was little'. I asked if there was anything I could do to help, that revelation running through my mind, and she looked down, a hint of a conflicted look on her face...and after she remained silent a bit longer, I took a bit of a leap, and asked...if she'd like me to stay here with her for a while.   
She bit her lip at that a little...then nodded, hesitantly...and when I reached for where she held onto my shirt with my own right hand, gently, she let go of them, and grabbed it, instead. I did my best to offer her a comforting smile, and said that she could go to sleep, then...I'd stay, I wouldn't leave her alone. My legs were getting a bit sore at that point from kneeling on thinly carpeted floor, but I did my best to ignore them, focusing on the more important matter at the time.

### 17606804

She finally drifted back off to sleep after another ten minutes or so, her grip on my hand relaxing...but I stayed where I was, just shifting to sit rather than kneel, keeping my hand where it was, under her own, beside her. I also remembered to switch my pager to vibrate, and leaned back against her bedside table, which really isn't as comfortable as you might imagine it to be. But she remained asleep until ten minutes before my shift ended, when I finally slipped away as carefully as I could...and she didn't wake up again, and while I'm not a mindreader, I think she slept as peacefully as she could have.   
Typing this all out ahead of time this time, after the bitching from last time...a single chunk of waiting better than scattered, periodic, ones? Ah, well. In b4 PEDO PEDO PEDO PEDO.

For the record, I never actually said I WANTED to stick it in her pooper. Even the remarks I did make were asking /b/ if I SHOULD stick it in her pooper. And providing risk/benefit details for analysis. Through a /b/ filter.   
But anyway: No, I am not particularly inclined to stick it in her pooper at this moment in time, no.

Well, angst has become a dirty word these days, tainted by the retarded antics of emo kids and goth faggots for longer than most of those current emo kids and goth faggots have been alive. In that vein (cut 4 attention, lols), I don't know that her situation would qualify as 'angsty', in the current use of the word.   
I'd term it 'drowning in a pool of shit', myself. And hey, if you feel so strongly about it, why not write it up as an adaptation of 'Waiting for Godot'? 'Waiting for crippled orphan loli pooper'. I demand royalties, however.

Actually, I don't even have any loli porn. Was never particularly interested, though, yes, as someone in /b/, I can hardly be said to have a small amount of familiarity with it.   
But, uh, the rest is varyingly degrees of more or less correct.

### 17608924

>  _I think you should have kissed her forehead as well... would have been sweet and reassuring - or at least do it once she is asleep bwahahahahaa!!_

Kissing is in a whole different realm of acceptability from a hug. I've seen plenty of nurses hugging patients. Hell, I've hugged patients, particularly people so old and decrepit they've more or less looped back around to the mentality and emotional needs of children. The shrink said hugging could be ok if I was reasonable and sensible about it.   
Since this isn't france, kissing isn't even to be considered. Yeah. (picture related)

### 17609370

Well, she certainly seems very intelligent to me, and was, from the gossip, in a school for the gifted of some sort. I wouldn't put it past her to have already read them all.   
But yeah, books are in consideration, I'm trying to figure out what she might like...I'm thinking about asking her more or less directly tonight, about what sort of things she might like.

Thank you, I'll look into that...   
As a /b/roadcast to anyone reading, any other suggestions for literature would be appreciated: It doesn't have to be strictly limited to her 'age group', as she's more than smart enough to read things that are aimed higher, but bear in mind that she's rather...fragile, so keep that in mind for content?

Any kissing, I meant, which is why I used France as an example, where non-lip kissing is casual. Cheek, forehead, wherever, it's a no-go.   
Nurses have even gotten in trouble for kissing a 'boo-boo' to make it better, even a bandaid covered one, and not for health or sanitation reasons. I'd make a 'think of the children!' remark, but that'd likely lure some pedo into going into a massive screed on how children need orgasms or some shit, so, yeah.

I dunno, I'd never experienced anything like this in /b/ before either...I mean, it's /b/. But, as a /b/tard that regards, with extreme disdain, the vast majority of other internets communities as vile pits of retarded excrement, where else was I going to post it?

Later on, she discovers that there is a sick boy also living in the relative's house but stays shut in his room all the time. Everybody tells him that he's sick and crippled (bad back). She brings him outside, introduce him to a farm boy, they work together in a (secret) garden and in the end he yells "See! I'm alright! I'm not sick!

>  _It's an incredibly positive book._

I know, I know it turns out nicely. Fuck, the christmas stage in Elite Beat Agents turns out nicely too (assuming you don't fuck it up).   
I still likely wouldn't try and get her to play it (which, yes, I've considered, playing DS with her). Not a matter of the content itself, but the person experiencing it.

>  _I was going to draw a pic of her and I was just wondering, in which side of the room is her bed, u said it was by a wall, dose that make her lie on the left or right side when turning out from the wall?_

If one were to 'face' the room from outside the hallway, and the far wall from the door/hallway wall were posited as 'North', the door would be in the south-east corner, her bed is at the northwest corner, length-wise against the west wall top-wise against the north wall, her bedside table is up along the top, at the north wall, there's a window above it, a dresser and the lone chair are in the northeast corner, the door leading to her bathroom is south of her bed, near the southwest corner. Her wheelchair is generally between her bedside table and the dresser.

The window has bars on it, unfortunately...designed to keep senile patients from trying to climb or break out of them...

Good for you! I was in a similar position, picking between doctor, paramedic, or nurse, and I'll admit that nurse was the last of the three choices.

Well, I can only try. I mean, even as terrible as they can be, and I am aware of those boundries, at least the vast majority of people living in nursing homes are at the end of their lives, their hopes and dreams and triumphs behind them...whereas it's just the opposite for her.

<a id="chapter6"></a>
## Part 6 (December 22nd) ##  


### 17700181

Hey, /b/. It's been a pretty busy couple of days, and I figured the daily updates were DO NOT WANTed, so I let yesterday go. Just as well, since, as I said, busy-ness.  
Anyway, I went in to speak with her on wednesday night when my shift began, finding her still awake, as is starting to seem more common than I'd thought. I asked her what she might like for christmas, since everyone was getting presents, after all, and I needed to tell Santa what she'd like before time ran short. She responded by telling me that she didn't want anything......and, flatly, that there was no santa. Ouch. I tried not to react too viscerally to her statement, though I wasn't sure just how to respond...and after a long silence, and not sure what else to do, I fished my DS out of my pocket, and asked her if she'd like to play a bit.  
She revealed that she'd had a DS of her own pre-accident, which isn't really that surprising, and when I turned on EBA, it soon came out that she'd had a copy of Ouendan; again not that surprising, particularly since she speaks and reads japanese, so wouldn't have a problem with importing...seems she'd been looking forward to playing EBA when it was released, as well. She was a little hesitant, but finally agreed to try it, and I fetched her prosthetic arm and helped her don it, a new experience in itself for me, then handed the DS over.

### 17700215

The problem arose, however, when she started the first stage on normal...she'd said that she'd been playing Ouendan on Insane difficulty before the accident, with the first note of pride in her voice I'd heard yet, so normal seemed like it'd be easy for her...but...it didn't turn out that way. She'd been right-handed before the accident, you see. And while she's gotten better with her left since the accident, another aspect of her rehab...well, people with EBA that've tried playing with their off-hand know where I'm going with this.  
She did...poorly. Embarassingly poorly...I know I would've been embarassed, as someone who's rather good at the game by now, too. She reacted by throwing the DS down, where it bounced off the corner of the bed, and nearly hit the floor...I was barely lucky, and fast, enough to catch it, then she turned away from me, staring at the wall, flushed. I felt pretty insensitive, not to have seen this coming; I had to try and set things right.

### 17700235

I put on a chagrined expression, and said that was mean of me, and that I was sorry. Then, I switched back out, into easy mode, then restarted the stage, hanging onto the DS myself this time, and...tried to play it with my own left hand. I did pretty shittily, as I'm sure you can imagine. At least as bad as her, actually, on normal. And when I failed, and lost the stage (despite really trying to win it), I smiled embarassedly as well, and offered it back to her, pointing out that I'd just been playing on this version's 'insane' mode earlier that day, and *I* sucked with my left.  
She didn't accept it quickly, but I eventually convinced her to try again. And by the third try, which came after a bit more convincing, she'd managed to beat it! I congratulated her happily, and managed to beat it myself, when she passed the DS back to me, insisting that I do it too. This continued onward, and she got better with her left faster than I did; I think she has a real talent for music, following the rhythm and the beats after only hearing it once, while I failed at music class and dropped out of the band by junior high.

### 17700253

I got called away by another patient around 2:30, leaving the DS with her and telling her I'd be back soon; unfortunately, it took longer than I'd anticipated, and I only managed to return around 3...whereupon I found her asleep, with the ds still on in her lap, and the headphone buds in her ears. I carefully removed both, managing not to wake her, and shifting her from a semi-sitting position to help her lay down...and, after a moment's thought, I keyed a message into the DS' message utility. 'havefun-dontplayxmasstage.'. Then I placed it on her bedside table, heading back to my station and fetching the ac adapter from my backpack, returning and plugging it in...and leaving it there. I left a note in my log about it and the night passed uneventfully, over before much longer.

### 17700276

When I got up and about on thursday afternoon, I gave her social worker a call, and after filling her in on who I was, and the general situation of the previous night's DS-activity and plans for christmas gifts, I asked her what had been done with her family's possessions after the accident. I was informed that many of them had been locked up in a storage company, with that same social worker having the key. When I brought up the possibility of retrieving her DS-lite and games from inside, the worker kind of hemmed and hawed at the trouble it'd take to find it, but I kept on her politely, bringing up christmas, how she'd seemed happier than I'd seen her before when she'd been playing with mine, how I'd help search for it...and, eventually, she relented, and said she'd look into it. I thanked her for her patience and christmas spirit, and the call was over.  
I headed out to the mall and picked up a copy of EBA from EB, then headed home and wrapped it up. Not much else happened, and I didn't hear back from her social worker...so I headed into work a bit early. I headed into the staff lounge first, and had a chat with her afternoon-evening shift nurse on how the DS had been recieved during the day; it seems she'd been playing with it, and took it to the rehab facility with her, most of the day, which was nice to hear! She said that her rehab nurse in charge of her arm usage had sent along a note in particular praising the idea of giving it to her, since she'd been getting more practice with her myoelectric hand by using it than she had otherwise since she'd started. Great success, party time.

### 17700288

I finally headed for my station, read through the reports, etc, and checked in on her room before too much longer. She was awake, and perhaps waiting for me, looking up from the DS when I opened the door. I asked how she was doing, if she was ready to kick my butt some more, and she actually smiled a bit at that! The first one I'd seen from her so far...it was all worth it, /b/, let me tell you. I couldn't control my own grin as I moved the chair and had a seat beside her, whereupon she showed me that she'd actually finished easy mode, and had moved onto normal. I asked her if she'd gotten my message, and played the christmas stage...and she got a bit quieter, then shook her head no, and said that she'd started it and watche the introduction...but...then she'd shut it off before playing the stage, already upset by it, though she didn't admit that directly. I reached out to pat her shoulder lightly, saying that it was okay...it's a sad stage for even grown-ups, and she didn't need to play it just yet.

### 17700305

Changing the subject somewhat, we started playing again, having a nice time, with her skills having improved considerably since I last saw them; she was now kicking my ass quite decisively, which seemed to please her, and that was fine by me, since her knowing she's better at something than an 'able' bodied person is a lot more important than my gaming ego. It was somewhat uneventful, really, and quite pleasent, for me certainly, for both of us hopefully...the only quirk was that she'd seemed to have memorized the songs in just a day or so, and every so often, she'd start singing along as she played, quietly, almost as if she didn't notice she was doing so.  
It was incredibly cute, frankly...she really does have a great voice, and she knows how to use it...it only got a little worrisome when she started singing along to 'la-la', the Cap White stage. People that know of the song and/or have played the stage will probably get why it was a little nervewracking when she started singing it...even if she didn't quite have the, um, energy of the woman that does the cover in the game (I have no idea what the original sounds like), and even if she didn't really seem to grasp the full meaning of what she was singing, it's not quite something someone that gave her the game to play wants other people to hear her repeating. I tried to explain this to her as best I could without getting into the details of why it was an inappropriate song for someone her age to sing, and while she may not have really 'gotten' it all, she said she wouldn't sing that one in public anymore. I felt kind of bad about asking her to restrain a show of expression from her...but I wasn't sure what any other options I might have.

### 17700311

Anyway, we played for an hour and a half or so, long enough for her to get to the last stage on normal with Bs (I only managed one B, mostly Cs and Ds, otherwise...I suck), before she clearly started getting tired, and a short while later, I helped tuck her in and get comfortable, giving her the minibear to hold, and I wished her a good sleep...I didn't mention anything about dreams, since I get the feeling that even wishing her sweet ones would do more harm than good, even if it was just a little. I stayed with her, sitting in the chair, until she drifted off...and began sleeping peacefully, more or less. I felt pretty good, I have to admit...and left the room shortly thereafter.  
Not much else happened during my shift, a couple of other patients needing something or another, wrote up my reports, and headed home when it was my time. Since I've woken up today, nothing much has happened...but I got a message from the social worker, saying she'd have time to check out the storage company just before she got off work, so I called her back to say I'd be there. Things are going pretty well so far, I'd say...it's nice to finally have some generally good news to report on her...I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it continues.

### 17700442

> _epic amount of text hits you for 122342342359982dmg._

Well, people did complain when I posted as I typed it out, so I did it ahead of time in notepad...guess I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't. Two days of events, too.  
Ah, well.

### 17700777

> _yay, anonynurse! you said you bought a copy of a game ... got the receipt to convince all those trollfags?_

As a matter of fact, I might just happen to have a picture of the reciept with sup /b/ on it, the wrapped box, and my scrubs, all in one picture...  
But, lacking a digital means of photography as I do, they would be on a conventional roll of film, inside a camera, at the moment. And since I don't generally take many pictures, said photo would have to wait until I filled the roll with more pictures over christmas before I got it developed.  
I suppose we'll all just have to wait until then to see if such a thing exists...

### 17700839

> _How do you use a DS with one arm?_

She uses the myoelectric hand on her artificial right arm to hold the DS, and plays with her left. It's not that hard (well, I'm not really one to say HOW hard it is, not having had to do so myself, but she doesn't make it look particularly hard).

### 17702148

> _Nurse-kun, you mentioned that the psychiatrist you talked to said that it would be good if you made it clear to amputee-chan that you are giving her special treatment; that you do not really act as "close" to the other patients. Since you sat down to play DS with her, she is probably aware of it, but have you told her this yourself yet?_  
Yes, more or less.  
> _umm, what exactly is that supposed to mean?_  
> _Such a vague answer must be bad..._

No, it just means that I've filled her in, just like our resident shrink told me to; I just didn't really feel like typing out a full account of my recollection of what I actually told her.

### 17702201

> _Once I hear the introduction of a mother into this story, then I KNOW it will be a Bel-Air._

Her mother is dead.  
Mine isn't, but I guess you'll need to wait until christmas to see me likely to mention her, probably. I'll try and surprise you at the lack of her getting scared?

### 17704214

> _at this point it is, sadly, myspace material.. go there and stfu until you get some pics or some sex storiez._

I'd explain why a myspace page might not be a good idea, but either willful or generic stupidity is a part of /b/, after all. That's what makes it so fun sometimes.  
Sometimes, anyway. But I'm just one more anonymous member of /b/, still, more or less...I doubt I'll affect /b/ any more than any of the hundreds of camwhores or furry bullet-magnets that 'contribute', and I don't expect any more adulation than they get.  
Of course, like them, I'll also keep posting to /b/, whether I'm told to GTFO or not.

### 17704802

And as I've stated already, I've cleared the attention I'm giving her with the people in charge. I'm not hiding anything, because I don't really have anything to hide.  
And think about this: How much stuff does a young, reasonably well-off, family with a child have, and where would it all go if, one day, they weren't coming home? I can't say I'm looking forward to digging through all of that aforementioned stuff, but I'll do it. Worse ways to spend an evening, I guess...

### 17704958

> _Nurse-kun, Nurse-kun! Considering that she is a poor amputee girl who likes video games, have you thought of getting some Child's Play love for her?_

Oh, that penny arcade thing? Actually, no, I hadn't considered that...isn't it generally targeted at children's hospitals and such? Her rehab facility (part of a hospital) might get involved, but I don't think a nursing home with one kid would qualify. Doubtful it'll happen this holiday season, anyway, but I might look into the hospital's involvement...

### 17705323

> _I like how in five days she's gone from "PTSD that makes fucked up vietnam veterans look healthy" to singing along to songs on a DS game._  
PTSD doesn't mean 'got turned into a rei-clone anime girl'. Considering some of the brightest minds in the mental health community are still struggling to find effective ways to treat it, let alone understand it well enough to begin trying to treat it, most expectations of behaviour should probably be discarded.

Yes, she seemed to be having fun for a brief while, and expressed herself a bit, vocally, sort of. There's a reason play therapy is one of the primary methodologies for dealing with traumatized children.  
She didn't exactly make a full 'reset-button' recovery when the credits on that encounter rolled. Life doesn't work like that.

### 17707855

OP here: Leaving to meet her social worker for the DS hunt. Wish me luck in finding it, since while I don't mind her using mine, if I don't find it tonight, she probably won't get hers back before christmas...and I wouldn't like that to happen.

<a id="chapter7"></a>
## Part 7: December 23rd, 2006 ##


### 17751291 ###

Hey, /b/. Need to keep this short, since I'm getting called in to sub for someone else this afternoon, starting my double-shifting marathon a day early.
After about four hours of shifting, lifting, and digging through boxes (guess it's a good thing I'm used to lifting heavy weights), I finally found several of You-know-who's stuff. I tried to keep from going through her things excessively, to respect her privacy, though what I did see made me feel bad, whenever I think about it since...athletics awards, music awards...she plays the piano and the violin, or did, well enough to...eh, forget about that.
Anyway, I eventually did manage to find her DS lite, which was packed with her games, too. I took everything involved, then packed up the rest of her stuff again, and squared it back away...it was almost nine by then, her social worker having left shortly after we arrived, putting the storage company's night manager in charge of overseeing things. The shed/container/etc was locked back up, and I headed back home to get ready for work, and wrapped up her things in a small box and christmas wrapping...when I got there, and presented it to her, as 'an early christmas gift', she seemed happy to see it, though it clearly stirred up more than a few emotions, too.

### 17751382 ###

Anyway, it went pretty well, all in all...need to get ready for work, so not much posting on my part today.
Oh, one detail I forgot to mention...her DS lite had a Samus Aran sticker on it. Good taste in heroines...

### 17752236 ###

Probably need to get going within 40 minutes or so...huh, and here I'd thought this was my 'usual' posting time. Ah, well.

### 17752441 ###

Thank you for your sentiment. Any and all support is appreciated, of course, half-incoherent or otherwise. It's the holidays...incoherent is the norm.
I haven't posted her name for a variety of reasons, most of which should be somewhat easy to understand...it's somewhat distinctive, if not completely unique, and while it suits her perfectly, it's a situation like pictures of her. Just probably not wise, sorry.

### 17753066 ###

She holds the DS steady with her myoelectric hand on her prosthetic arm, and plays with the stylus using her natural one. She's gotten quite good at holding it steady, actually.

### 17753125 ###

Thanks again. I haven't been able to settle on a good book choice yet, I'll probably wind up buying something on christmas, or something...such is my habit of procrastination.

<a id="chapter7a"></a>
### The End? (troll attempt #1) ###

> Nurse-kun made a final story post on New Year's Eve, saying only this about the situation:

"[I] Fucking cared. That was my fucking mistake. Those fucking assholes from her mom's side of the family showed up, out of fucking nowhere, as far as I'm aware, anyway, off she goes, never visit her in the hospital, never call or write or even acknowledge her existence, but they can just walk in and hey, sure, here you go, you're obviously totally qualified to take care of her, and fuck it all fucking merry christmas to fucking retarded me."

### Epilogue ###

"Hey, /b/. Happy New Year. I woke up a little while ago, and I guess I'm feeling a bit better...or, at least, a bit more coherent. I'm sorry for all that emo bullshit earlier, it's just that...well, it hurt. But I need to think about what's best for her, not what's best for me...that was always the point, after all, wasn't it? I'll try and get in touch with her social worker tomorrow, see if I can get her new contact information, with the explanation that I had a new years card I wanted to give to her (true), and I need somewhere to send it now. When I can do so, I'll try and talk to her uncle and aunt, offer my expertise, such as it is, as one of her former caretakers, and offer any assistance I can give them, whether it's advice, or anything else...it may be hard, leaving the things and people I know, but it's not about me, it's about her.

"It's about doing whatever I can to make sure her life got flipped-turned upside down, and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the nurse of a town called Bel-Air. In west Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool, and all shootin some b-ball outside of the school...when a couple of guys who were up to no good, started makin' trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one lil fight and my mom got scared...She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in bel Air'. I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I can say this cab was rare, but I thought 'Nah forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air!'. I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8, and I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes, smell ya later'; I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there...to sit on my throne as the Nurse of Bel-Air."

---

This is of questionable authenticity, but would have been really
fucking sad and epic if it was true. Since Nurse-kun says in Chapter 8 that he hasn't posted since Christmas morning, this is likely a troll as first post consisted of nothing but "Hey, /b/." (No.18232915), subsequent posts lacked Nurse-kun's writing style, and the time required to relinquish a ward of the state (in any state) would have made her case worker aware of ampu-tan's family's intentions well before Christmas. It is also possible that Nurse-kun was drunk while writing this post. This (getting drunk) would be the logical thing to do in such a situation.

<a id="chapter8"></a>
## Part 8: January 21st, 2007  ##


### 19404540

Hey, /b/. I just realized, yesterday, that it's been almost a month since I last posted here; mostly due to my busy schedule this time of year, partly due to what seemed like a lack of interest. I've barely had time to even browse /b/, as it is, being occupied with errands to run and double shifts to work.

She, and by 'she' I refer to 'Amputee-tan' or 'Maimed-tan' or 'Damaged-Goods-Tan' or whatever else you may call her, has been doing relatively well for the last few weeks, at least, since the primary holiday season ended. She enjoyed the gifts I rustled up for her (with the assistance of some smaller contributions from the rest of the staff), said gifts including her own copy of EBA, several books, and an ipod; the stuff my own family came up with later on christmas day went over pretty well too, mostly consisting of clothes and books...she's still wearing the sweater my mom got her quite a bit.

### 19404818

Like I was saying before, it's been pretty hectic. I've approached her social worker to make some inquiries about the possibilities of guardianship, and how one would go about applying for such things, and she was somewhat helpful, thankfully, though she has warned me that it wouldn't be easy, for reasons I've listed before. Still, I'm working at it, and my cousin the lawyer, who I'd also mentioned and who was there at christmas, has been lending a hand as well, pro-bono, looking into and inquiring about, family law with a friend and colleague that specializes in the field. All in all, that aspect is looking pretty good, particularly since I have my family's support in this...they all thought she was pretty darn awesome when they showed up at the home christmas night, and met her for themselves...which felt really good to see, since she took it so well.

### 19404942

There's really just too much to talk about, if I were to mention everything...I could write a small book, really, and since I'm not a writer, and it's my day off, that isn't terribly appealing to me. So I guess I'll open the floor to questions, and try to answer them as best I can, at this point. You know, if anyone cares enough to have any, that is.

Oh, one note before I do so: I did wind up sticking it in her pooper. It was messy.
(ok, joke made out of her problem with constipation and the application of suppositories out of the way now)

### 19405100

Since most of the residents don't know what the hell an iPod is, let alone what to do with it, and the staff helped get it for her and all know who's it is (the 'Property of 'Her Name'' engraved on the back helps there), it shouldn't be much of a problem. If a visitor or someone at the rehab facility were to do so, I'm fairly sure that our friendly neighbourhood Swarthy Security Specialist would track up the culprit and break his/her kneecaps before retrieving it.

She and he have struck up a bit of a rapport in the last few weeks, as it turns out that she'd had a friend in her class pre-accident that belonged to his particular class/sect combination, so she 'gets him' in those ways more than pretty much any of us adults.

### 19405262

Bel-Air? Taken away? What? Shit, someone actually tried to copypasta as me? I don't know if I should feel honored or offended. Was this stuff in the wiki?

Anyway, no, it isn't a Bel-Air (as if people that believe that will believe me saying so), and she wasn't taken away...I haven't posted since christmas morning, so if I've been 'seen' since then, it wasn't me.

### 19405437

I have the headstart on her, but she's got the skills with her 'off' hand on me. And she's been playing it for over a month now, and is doing pretty fucking awesome at it in doing so...she's most of the way through Hard ROCK mode (god, she did not handle the christmas stage well, as I predicted, but she's more or less gotten used to it by now), and generally whoops my non-crippled ass on that difficulty when we play head to head. I can barely make it up to Let's Dance/Anthem/Survivor's 'level' on that difficulty, as is...she's just stuck on JJF, but she's getting closer to beating it all the time.

Her 'hands' rehab nurse has mentioned that it's been really helpful to her skill with her left hand, and she's doing better with her new right myoelectric all the time. I'm just glad she's having fun.

### 19405571

Sadly, my skills at visual art are more or less nonexistent. I couldn't even manage a decent stick figure of her if I tried.

### 19405733

Well, my last two posts disappeared within ten minutes or so, with about 20 posts to each apiece, a quarter of which were me, and half of which were 'gtfo fag'...a guy can get the message after awhile.

### 19406143

Well...she hasn't exactly started arm-thrusting herself out of her bed to flying-hug me when I walk into her room or anything, but I like to think she's continuing to open up to me, slowly but surely...

We talk more, now, when she can't sleep, or after she has another nightmare (which are still very commonplace). About anything she'd like, which usually includes what happened during the day, while I was away. She's telling me about things that frustrate or annoy her, rather than keeping it all to herself, and at the same time, she's also admitting it when she likes or enjoys something, too, which is even newer. I've managed to fill her iPod with most of the songs she's asked for (has an amazing memory, can list exact track and artist names and sources for most of them, which I, well, can't), which has helped too, particularly on the bussing to and from the rehab facility, I've been told.

Our resident headshrinker says that she mentions me fairly often in sessions, almost always in a positive way, which is good...and when it hasn't been overly positive, I've tried to correct my behaviour when I can, but a lot of those 'problems' seem to stem from being reminded of her father, thus making her feel bad...

### 19406604

For the record, though I mentioned this initially, it wasn't technically BUTTSEX. It was a professional doing a professional's job for a suffering patient, that's all. No more, no less.

I even wore a latex glove while doing so, which is not standard BUTTSEX protocal, as far as I am aware (my BUTTSEX familiarity is somewhat lacking, I will admit)

### 19407451

She's beautiful. Beautiful for a child, that is, of course, rather than an adult's beautiful. Even as broken as she still is inside, and with the scarring over her eye, I'd say she's the most beautiful little girl I've ever seen.

Well, she is. You'd agree with me if you saw her.

### 19407601

At this point, some sort of 'arrangement' (which is pretty messed up even outside of official scrutiny, I mean, really) would probably just do more harm than good for my petition. As for girlfriends, I don't have any issues with seeking them out, and I've actually been getting to know the new girl at the local coffeeshop, considering asking her out the next time I'm in there (which will probably be tomorrow).

Still, if it does happen, it's the sort of commitment that would need to be made by everyone involved in the household, including any girlfriends...and it's also the sort that tends to drive casual people away and split previously strong marriages apart. I can always hope, but it's a big thing to face.

### 19407763

I'm not sure, but from what the social worker and my cousin have indicated, it'd be at least a month or so in red tape before any progress was made from the time a formal application for consideration is made and the time it gets looked at by someone in authority, even. Actual vettings and such would be longer, of course.

### 19408225

Well...she's talked about how when I've been nice to her, particularly when comforting her after nightmares, that I make her think about her father. Which, considering her circumstances, is a painful thing to do, even if all her memories of him are good ones...maybe especially because they're good ones. I mean, it isn't healthy for her to have withdrawn as much as she has, a common symptom in PTSD, and she needs to learn to 'feel' again without 'flinching', but...it still hurts, she's said, and I'd have to imagine.
It makes me feel bad for her, and good inside for her comparing me to him, having clearly loved him tremendously as she did...very conflicting...

### 19408978

Well, I may try to be a bit more frequent in my updates, since at least a few people still seem to care, faggort-flooders aside.

As a side note, I finally read through Nana's Everyday Life on Dan Kim's website a few weeks back, for the first time...

...it just hardened my resolve to do the right thing for this real girl. Fiction will remain that way, if I have anything to say about it.

### 19409105

I haven't given them any reason to suspect me of anything, mostly because I really haven't done anything wrong, as of yet. I mean, the suppository incident was the deepest I've waded into shit creek thus far (ho ho, i am so witty), and even that was just me doing my job...the fact that I've talked about her with most of them, and made the fact that her situation makes me feel for her clear, probably helps with my general transparency level, too, of course.

### 19409897

It was december 28th, and all was calm as I came into work for the first of two shifts I'd be working that day...3 pm, the late-afternoon to evening shift, and then my usual 11 to 7 night shift. I'd been working double-shifts for more than a week now, and I was beginning to approach the fine edge of raggedness, but I was soldiering on like a good little trooper as is the role of the nurse, after all.

She'd been pretty calm for the past few days, the unexpected buoying of christmas spirit outpouring overcoming the sting of loss she'd felt at facing her first yuletide alone. The only notable incident had been two days previous, when she'd been trying to stand on her own, beside her bed, on her still-new legs, and taken a fall...when I found her, hearing the crash of plastic and metal prosthetics against furniture in her downward arc from the hallway, she was already in angry tears, biting her lip and practically tearing her legs off herself in frustration, a state which I had to work hard to calm her up from, indeed.

### 19410205

I was giving the log of the morning's activities a quick read-through before getting to the real business at hand when I noted a note in the notices section of her file: 'patient appears to be suffering from abdominal discomfort, refused breakfast'. A frown of worry crossing my face, and making sure there weren't any outstanding calls for assistance (there weren't), I headed for her room, knocking lightly with the back of my hand before opening the door and peeking inside.

She was curled up on her right side, facing the wall, and appeared to have her earbuds in, listening to her iPod. Figuring that she wouldn't notice me from where I was, particularly as she hadn't made any sign that she had as of yet, I stepped into her room, closing the door behind myself and approaching her bed.

### 19410576

Once I got close, I spoke her name loudly enough for her to hear, with her starting slightly from where she'd been reading one of her new books. After she'd sat up somewhat and removed her earphones, and I'd apologized for startling her, I asked her how she was feeling. She told me that she was fine...a bit evasively, but I'd grown accustomed to her tendency to hide her true state of affairs for one reason or another, so a clear conclusion of how she really felt was hard to arrive at. Still, there was little point in badgering her, so I changed the subject, making light conversation about how her morning had been, how her rehab had gone (she'd just returned a few minutes before I arrived at work), and so on, and so forth. I was called away before too long and had to attend to my other patients, leaving her alone again, as always.

### 19411110

The Greatest Generation kept me busy until around seven that evening; she generally had her meals brought to her in her room, very rarely feeling sociable enough to brave the horrors of the senile geriatric dining experience. When I finally had a short break in the neverending stream of depends and ben gay, I checked in on her again, just to be sure...and, sure enough, she'd barely touched her dinner tray, just having sipped some juice, already reading another book (fortunately, the family practically bought a crate of them for her, considering the rate at which she went through them).

I pulled up her chair to her bedside and took a seat, probably looking worried, as it was how I felt. I asked how she was feeling, again, and she looked up, again, and said she was fine...just not feeling very hungry, that's all. Then she told me that she needed to use the washroom, in what I later realized was an attempt to change the subject of her own; still, I carried her over, and she did urinate, at least a bit, so my concerns were assuaged somewhat. I helped her get cleaned up, then took her back to her bed, telling her I'd be back in a bit longer, that we could play some mario kart, as I was being called away by more calls from the damned old.

### 19411831

Another three hours passed by before I was even able to check my watch again, and as the ice-floe candidates began to pack it in for the night, to dream of jalopies and punching nazis and segregated drinking fountains, I finally made my way back to her room.

I opened her door to find her laying on her side again, curled up (as much as she can, anyway, what remains of her thighs drawn up toward her stomach) and making small whimpering sounds. Needless to say, I found this very worrisome, and rushed right over to her bedside, asking her what was wrong. After a moment's hesitation, she finally admitted that her stomach had hurt since last night...and, after a few more moments of consideration, the conclusion was reached that she hadn't had a proper bowel movement in at least five days. It seems that she'd been somewhat embarassed to ask me to he;lp her with that particular bodily function in the washroom, and that 'holding in' while I'd started working double shifts, combined with another new nurse on the third shift of the day, with her usual two on vacation, combined with the painkillers she was still on due to lingering pain at her amputation sites...well, it all combined to make for a painful package, pardon the pun.

### 19412408

I was somewhat dumbstruck my this situation, to say the least. I mean, I'd already been assisting her with washroom trips for number 1, and while it had been decided that policy in her case would be that the female nurses would bathe her (understandable, really), it wasn't as though I hadn't seen anything, thus far. Still, turning it over in my mind, I had to admit that I'd never helped her with this before...maybe she had a reason for shyness in this area, I really didn't know, one way or another...but I did know that it was my duty to help her, somehow.

She was still trying to suppress little whimpers of pain as all of the above ran through my little mind, and I pulled myself back to the present, taking her small hand into my own and giving it a gentle squeeze, giving my best reassuring smile at the same time. I told her it was all right, that she didn't do anything wrong...and that I could help her. I began to explain how an enema works...and she cut me off, an upset expression on her face as she told me that she'd already had that done once, while she was in the hospital, and she never wanted it to happen again, that she hated how it made her feel in her 'tummy'. I was a little surprised, but recovered admirably, I think...and after a mere second's thought, I propose...the route of the suppository.

### 19412760

She was rather hesitant and nervous once I explained said alternative to her, but I assured her that it was quick, firstly, and that it was one of the two recommended treatments for someone her age with her problem, the other being the fleet enema. She finally accepted it, but clearly wasn't too thrilled...I couldn't really blame her, and patted her shoulder gently, extricating my own hand and heading for the supply room for the necessary materials.

Doublechecking the instructions on the package, I split one of the suppositories in half, and, with an extra pair of latex gloves and lubricant in hand, headed back to her room, doublechecking my pager on the way, to make sure there weren't any other emergencies to distract me.

### 19414015

Anyway, I got back to the room, and further explained the procedure to her. She didn't look too thrilled, but really, who could blame her? I could only promise her that I'd be as gentle as possible, and that I'd bring her some ice cream from the kitchen after it was over...somewhat transparent bribery, true, but I had to try something a bit softer than 'suck it up (your pooper)'.

I helped her remove her underwear, setting it aside, and tugging her gown up slightly, to leave her rear exposed, then, after a quick hand sanitizer application, I donned the latex gloves, and squeezed a dab of lubricant onto the tip of my right middle finger, since I'd be using my index finger to peel the suppository in a moment. With a calming word of warning ahead of time, I spread her cheeks gently, just enough to expose her anus, with my left hand, and shifted my right in to carefully rub the bead of lube over and into it, just a bit...she tensed up at first, gasping softly, and I paused, letting her adjust...

### 19414601

After about five seconds of her trying to instinctively 'squeeze me out', she finally started to relax, my murmered encouragement and praise for her courage perhaps helping, perhaps not, and I withdrew, reasoning from experience that it was better to get it out of the way now than while trying to actually insert the tablet. Patting her shoulder and telling her how well she was doing, I moved on to unwrap the foil from the tablet, and scrape away the bit of an edge the machine left on one side, while applying a light coating of the remaining lube from my middle finger to the 'top' of the tablet, pointed for easier insertion. Then I squeezed a more generous quantity onto my index finger's length, gripped the suppository between said index finger and thumb, and spread her cheeks again, letting her know to relax, as I placed the tip against her anus.

I shifted my left hand, now that my finger was ready and waiting, up to tug the glove off, and offer said hand to her...after a moment, she reached out to squeeze it with her own, and I told her that it'd be over in a few seconds. I began counting up from three, and as I finished, I pressed in, gently but firmly, and after a momentary resistance, slipped the tablet, and my finger, inside her.

### 19415115

She cried out as I entered her, mostly out of surprise, as it was a new experience for her, despite having had other entries in the past. Her hand squeezed mine almost painfully, as tightly as she could, her eyes squeezed shut when I looked up to her face to make sure she was all right...it wasn't an expression of serious pain, just of discomfort, so I continued, to try and get it over with as quickly as I could.
Sliding my finger in further, squeezed on all sides by impressive pressure and heat, I soon met some resistance as it reached her hardened stool. Sliding my finger around just a bit, to see if it could go any further, she groaned, trying to stifle herself without much success, her hips shifting uneasily, hand squeezing mine again. Realizing that attempting a deeper penetration wouldn't do much good, I relented, nudging the suppository away from my fingertip as I started to withdraw it, not lingering unduly, but not moving too fast, to avoid exacerbating the situation. Finally, as my finger slid out of her anus completely, a small wet sound accompanying it as she squeezed shut behind it, she moaned one last time, her hips shifting again on the bed, as I peeled the glove off as best I could, using my teeth on the wristline, and tossed it, with the other one, into her wastebasket.

### 19415515

I tugged her gown back up to he;lp her cover herself up, and pulled the sheets up a bit as well, to cover her stumps, giving her hand a squeeze as it continued to hold onto my own, and telling her how brave she was, and how well she handled that, helping her turn onto her back back, and reaching up to brush her hair out of her eyes with my free hand as she opened them again. I told her how it'd be a while before it finished working, and she asked me to stay with her while it did, looking a bit scared; I promised that I would, and moved to sit on the edge of the bed beside her, continuing to hold her hand within my own.

After about five minutes, she started to shift about beneath the bedsheets, and complained that she felt uncomfortable 'in there', that it burned a little...I reassured her that it was normal to feel that way, and that it wouldn't be too much longer...as time went on, it just got worse, but she just bit her lip and made a visible effort to ignore it after ten minutes, though her hand started squeezing mine more tightly.

### 19416030

I did my best to be a soothing presence, stroking her hair with my free hand, while murmering words of encouragement, praising her on how well she was handling it...and, eventually, as we approached the half-hour mark, she began to shift more and more urgently under the bedsheets, her thighs rubbing together, until finally, she groaned again, deeply, and told me, a bit panickedly, that it was time. I scooped her up as quickly as I could, having shifted to a more ready position as I anticipated things coming to a head, and hurried into the washroom, helping her to take her seat on the toilet, and holding her steady with my free hand on her hip, my left still tightly held in her own, as she began moaning again, her eyes squeezed tightly shut, hunching forward slightly...

And, well, she relieved herself. I'll spare you the details. I helped her clean up after she was finished, which took a while, and left her drenched in sweat, giving her a quick abbreviated spongebath in her bathing area, then carried her back to her bed and laid her up again. I told her that she didn't need to be shy about asking me, or the other nurses, for he;lp when she needed it...not even for this; that hopefully, one experience like this would be enough, to which she agreed. Then she leaned toward me, and gave me her best attempt at a hug...which, once I got past surprise, I returned.

### 19416456

> _re: "nurse-kun is awesum! it's not a very interesting question but what's in that iPod? What does she listen to?"_

To answer this question rather late, she listens to a lot of different things; some japanese pop stuff, which I have no ideas the subtleties of, but I'm sure she does; classical music, mozart and beethoven in particular; a few videogame tracks; and some assorted miscellaneous stuff, including copies of the original songs from EBA, which she asked me for but hadn't had before, and I tracked up, eventually. She's a pretty eclectic little kid.

### 19416554

> _re: "How is her treatment and rehabilitation progressing? I know you mentioned she was doing well with her DS, but how well can she use her legs, etc?"_

Her rehab is progressing well, all in all. She's getting better with her legs all the time, and tried the standing-by-her-bed trick I mentioned her failing at nearly a month ago again while I was watching, just recently, and succeeded, shaky though she was...she was in a pretty good mood for the rest of the night after that.

## Part 9: January 24th, 2007 ##


### 19530627 ###

Hey, /b/. Just a quick check-in as I get ready for work, having been busy all day running errands and meeting with various people to do various other things. I figure that some of you might care, so I'll drop off the tidbit, and let you see for yourselves.

Inspired by a few comments at the end of sunday's thread before I was called away and it disappeared, I thought to myself: Why not? And I went out on monday to pick up a book on origami, and a package of origami-specialized paper. I know, unoriginal.

### 19530851 ###

I presented it to her after I signed into work and found no emergencies waiting; she wasn't so hot on the idea at first, similar to her initial reaction to the DS, but I offered to give it a try first, and demonstrate that I was willing to show my own ineptitude, just to prove that a less than perfect first attempt on her part wouldn't be 'her fault'.

My first crane, which was the only origami I ever actually made before then, back in grade nine, looked like it'd been hatched on top of a toxic waste dump, to be kind. It actually provoked a short, stifled laugh from her, which is always very nice to hear, rare as it is, and the fact that she did try to stifle it made me feel a bit better about how badly I'd sucked.

### 19531152 ###

She was still somewhat hesitant, but after a bit of friendly coaxing, she eventually consented to try one, at least. It seems that she'd had at least a little experience with origami before then, which isn't that surprising, considering her mother's parentage, so she didn't need to check the book (she has an amazing memory, as I believe I've mentioned before). I fetched her arm from where it rested beside her bedside and helped her don it, something she's gotten comfortable with my doing, thankfully, and fetched a square for her.
It took her a while, in a state of intense concentration, and I practically held my breath as the crane began to take shape. It was clear that her lack of stereoscopic vision was making it harder for her than it'd been for me, particularly once it began to 'move past' flat folding to giving it three dimensions.

### 19531472 ###

Still, she was doing much better than I had been. Not perfectly, of course, as it was clear that this was a new 'exercise' for her, but very well indeed, all in all. It took her about five minutes, and I was almost ready to jump in and offer her some he;lp at a few points, but I managed to resist, thankfully. She even eventually wound up using her mouth as a secondary grasping tool (something she's been doing for a while, though not in a dirty way, you perverts), and the wings flapped out, and there it was. Sure, it was a bit of an ugly eggling, but it looked considerably better than mine, which seemed to please her, though not in a petty way.

Her looking pleased was enough to make me look that way too. And we went on to make a couple more before I was called away; I returned after a half hour to find another half-dozen waiting for me.

### 19531714 ###

Each of them looked a little better than the previous one, and she seemed pleased by my admiration for her work, even smiling a little, just for a few seconds, at least. We started work on trying a frog next, and, well, time runs short, so I'll synopsize: It was a nice couple of hours, all in all, before she eventually drifted off around one. I'm glad I did it, and I'm looking forward to what I'll find when I show up at work in 45 minutes or so. I'll need to leave in another 15, so I won't be around as long as usual this time, but, well, hey, here you go. She kicks that whiny emo kid's ass in all ways.

### 19531919 ###

> _Im the guy who suggested the chocolate orange. Do you ever sneak in a longer touch when putting on her arm or is it purely proffessional and succinct? Maybe something she wouldn't notice but you would. Embrace a bit of pedo into your heart man!_

Too many questions to answer them all, but I will do this one: No, I haven't. I touch her enough while I'm helping her put them on as it is, let alone for other reasons, and touching her inappropriately would just be more trouble than it's worth, not to mention it being not good in general.

The fact that she's come to be comfortable with me to this extent, moreso than the other nurses, isn't something I want to ruin.

### 19532378 ###

Well, I need to get going now...sorry, like I said, it had to be a short one. Takes me at least 20 minutes on a good night to get from my place to my workplace, so, yeah. Have a good night, /b/, I'll see about updating earlier next time. Oh, and now that it's popped back into my head: To whoever posted on the wiki about going into a field in college related to prosthetics, you have my admiration. Good for you, and good luck. I'm not sure how I feel about having sort of inspired someone else like that, but...still, wow.

See you, I'm out.

<a id="chapter10"></a>
## Part 10 (January 24th, 2007) ##


### 19558499 ###

Hey, /b/. I don't have a whole lot to tell you about today, but I did sort-of promise to check in a bit earlier the next time I posted, last night, so here I am. Though I almost did prefer last night's thread, as it was free of spamming, short as it may have been (I don't count the loli pictures as spamming...I think).
Anyway: Last night was mostly uneventful...I showed up, as usual, checked the logs, noted that a couple of comments had been entered on her new origami hobby, all positive, and eventually checked in on her after making sure my other 'wards' were peacefully dreaming of whatever it is people older than I can really fully comprehend within my own head dream of. I found that she was still awake, as usual, (we've discussed it, and she admits she's started staying up to spend more time with me...more on that later), and that her bedside table was covered in miniature paper animals.

### 19558937 ###

I noted to her that she'd been pretty busy, to which she replied that she'd come to enjoy it after all, and gotten better; she offered one of her latest 'models', made just a half-hour earlier, in anticipation of my arrival, for inspection, to prove her point. It was as fine a paper crane as I've seen, personally, though I admit that one can really only 'perfect' origami so far. Still, she'd managed even tiny little details, like a creased beak to give it more 'depth', and folds along the mid-section of the wings that were then rotated slightly, giving them the illusion of being in mid-folding (the not-paper kind) as it came to rest. I gave her my honest reaction of impressed praise, which she clearly seemed to appreciate, even as normally subdued as her reaction was.

I took up the book and studied her other creations, finding that she'd been progressing through it...not as perfect as her crane yet, but still quite recognizable for what they were meant to be. It took me a doubletake, but I even noticed that she'd made a tiny origami bear, which was 'sitting' between her original bear's legs where it sat on the table beside her lamp. I made a joke that she'd left me behind in the dust, and could do fine without my he;lp; to which she grew a bit upset, and said I'd promised to practice with her...

### 19559354 ###

I reassured her that I'd just been joking, and I wouldn't be giving up just yet; then proceeded to make mutant abominations of various sorts with my left hand for the next half hour, with her offering the occasional suggestion for how to handle some tricky parts every now and then.

I got called away just afterward by a patient that'd caught the flu after a visit from his family earlier in the week ('tis the season, goddamnit, hurray), so off I went; of course, once he'd been taken care of and sent back to sleep a bit more comfortable, another patient across the hall from him had woken up and gotten agitated...I swear, sometimes I think they develop some sort of geriatric hive mind, after a while. I eventually managed to calm her up as well, after nearly a half-hour's work, and got back to you-know-who's room, only to find that she'd since fallen asleep, a half-finished turtle still resting in her lap. I turned her lamp off (leaving her nightlight on), set her ninja turtle in training on her table, and tucked her in carefully...then let her be, and headed back to my station. No nightmares afterward, thankfully, so it ended as well as any night could, anyway.

### 19559403 ###

> _is this a Nurse-kun thread? ;_;_

Well, I guess so, as I'm 'Nurse-kun', and I started a thread? I've been doing that again, lately.

### 19559676 ###

I've been thinking about what she's said a few times before...about how she's admitted to staying up even when she's tired, to see me, presumably because she doesn't feel very interested in most of the people around during the day, particularly her fellow residents. I can't say I blame her, since, well, would any of you really want to live with a bunch of geriatrics, let alone with many of them being senile, as well? I know I wouldn't, and I do it for a living, sort of. Plus, the nurses are always busy during the day and early evening shifts, said geriatrics keeping our hands full, to the point where I often barely managed to see her at all during the morning or day shifts while I was doubleshifting for a while there. She needs attention, and the system isn't really designed to give it to her, particularly since (though getting her to admit it even slightly was tough for me, let alone someone else) she feels uncomfortable around the other patients, particularly since it means she has to be confined to her wheelchair while she's amongst them (which she still hates), so group activities are less than optimal; since most of the 'attention-giving' in a facility like this is given to groups of patients at once, rather than one at a time, due to simple resource shortages...well...

### 19560001 ###

Anyway, I'm considering looking into volunteering some of my off-hours to 'keep her company' during the day when she isn't busy with her rehab or whatnot, as a 'quasi-family-visitor', since they have the right to take their old person out of the home for outside activities and such, even if most of them rarely do, sadly. Of course, my being approved for that status isn't exactly going to be as simple as a rubberstamping, so I'll have to discuss it with her social worker and the head admin first, and expect some deliberations...still, if it is approved, and I think it may be possible, it could only he;lp any future chances with the adoption possibility (unless a meteorite hits her while we're in the park or something, but that's a slim possibility), so it'd be worth it.

Just something I'm thinking about today, and was yesterday, anyway...that's about it for my rambling storytelling manglings, though I'll be around my apartment for a while yet, and I'll check the thread. (will not be killing self just yet, apologies, fine sir)

### 19560076 ###

> _Woot! Glad to hear from ya! So how's the legal process going?_

Still in preliminaries, if that. My cousin dropped me an email on monday mentioning that he was going to be having lunch with his friend that works in family law next week, so he might have some more advice for me then.

### 19560465 ###

> _Hate to rehash this nurse-kun... but /b/ really needs pictures desperatly._  
> _I don't know what it will take... but whatever it is it must be done._

I'm aware of /b/'s 'needs', but at this point, I still don't think it'd be a wise course of action...I mean, not just legally or job-wise, even, but I think I'd feel bad if I did it...I know this is kind of GTFO material, but I'd feel guilty if I delivered her likeness into /b/'s clutches, her description and circumstances is bad enough.

### 19561009 ###

> _She is being tested by our Lord (May he ninja forever), to see if she is fit. Perhaps this is the prophesied one who will save /b/ from gaiafags and their ilk._

Well, and I just remembered this incident, she got into a fight with one of the geriatrics a week ago, when she was waiting in the front lobby for her transportation to her rehab, and he wandered in to bother the front desk receptionist about whether his children had arrived yet to visit him (he apparently does this at least twice a day, even when they aren't scheduled or expected, even on his good days, on his bad days, well...). And after he'd bugged her for a couple of minutes, with the receptionist telling him they weren't coming, his attention drifted over to 'her', where she'd been sitting and reading relatively quietly, like she normally does.

Apparently, this was not one of his best days, and he approached her, and started mumbling something about japs (seems he fought in WWII), with her ignoring him at first, and him escalating in volume and intensity as he got closer, which the receptionist noticed, thankfully, and called for security. He was right in front of her by the time they arrived, ranting about the fucking japs and a bunch of other slurs and propaganda-pieces from the time at her, and he started yelling about 'his buddies' and how he was 'gonna show her'.

### 19561338 ###

Now, when he'd started ranting relatively close to her and spewing the racial slurs, (including somewhat coherent suggestions of her being a rape baby from a white woman and a jap bastard) she'd started returning the favour. She set her book up, and looked up at him, and told him his family didn't really love him, that they locked him away in here because they hated having to take care of him, because he was too useless and stupid and ugly to be worth the trouble, cold as ice. That's when he really started flipping out and mentioned the whole 'show her' part, and that's about when security reached him just as he started reaching for her in her chair, and hauled him off.

I admit now, up front, that I was told about all this when I came into work later that night, by the Indian security guy up front, who'd heard it from the front desk receptionist, before she went home, and from his boys in security, too. I asked around, and other people verified the details, so it seems to be true...if she can drive a WWII pacific theatre combat vet to the point of violence, imagine all the gaiafags she could make cry with one post? God, I love her, I really do.

### 19561886 ###

> _omg, hurse-kun. First time i have actuly see one of your threads on here! I've been reading your story from the wikichan and i have to say man, you are a modern day 'knight in shining armor'. You show that dispite the shit of the world theres still an awsome glimer of hope somewhare for the human race. it makes my heart fucking swell man, props to you._

I'm really not that special...I mean, it's not like I'm adopting some poor kid in Russia that I've never seen...I met her, I was exposed to her, I reacted to personal stimuli. I'd say that just makes me human, nothing more. I daresay most of /b/ would've felt something, though just what, and how much of it, would vary depending on which particular /b/tard it was, of course...

### 19561979 ###

> _Time Paradox! According to the archives at Wikichan Mangled-chan was picked up by distant Japanese relatives . . . What do I beleive! How do I know you are the real Nurse-Kun?_

Well, I didn't write that, but, as always, I don't particularly have any evidence to prove that. Guess you'll just have to trust me?

### 19562312 ###

> _unfortunatly we are being spam-fucked_  
> _Im glad she stuck up for herself that way - good for her - if I was her age I would have punched him in the nose and started crying :p_

Isn't there a rule about needing to be 18+ to be on 4chan? I mean, maybe it's just me, but the fact that he showed up fifteen minutes after class lets out in k-12 on the east coast...

Ah, well. A one-limbed girl in a wheelchair still isn't a match for an 80+ year old guy, unfortunately. Thankfully, he was removed before the situation got any worse, and security's been a bit tighter around her since then.

### 19562456 ###

> _She's practicing Origami? Last I heard she was playing her old Nintendo DS to improve her coordination . . ._

She's still playing with her DS. She's just been having some fun with the origami since I gave it to her on monday night. Reminds me, I need to buy her more paper before I head in tonight...

### 19562509 ###

> _May I suggest that Nurse-kun start a new thread...?_

What's the point? Wastes of bandwidth like that will just move into a new thread as well, in addition to irritating more neutral /b/tards that see a new thread and mentally mutter to themselves about there being an infestation of them, which may drive them to become hostile as well...

Can't win if I do, can't win if I don't. Since the mods don't give a shit about bot-spam, there's really nothing I can do at all.

### 19562822 ###

> _Get her some music! I'm dead serious, ask her what she likes and if it's shite, pick out something good. Something exotic that will offer her a escape from reality._  
> _Get her volumes 1-3 of Berserk to start with too. Too, that would be a perfect story for an amputee that's lost their family._

I already got her an iPod for christmas, as I've mentioned before, and it's full of various bits of music she asked me to load onto it for her.

I'm not sure Berserk would be looked upon as an age-appropriate gift for her. Hell, I might be charged with corrupting a minor if I gave it to her and got caught.

## Part Eleven (January 28th)  ##


### 19727602  ###

Hey, /b/. Your friendly neighbourhood male nurse is here once more, with How do I shot Injections and lol i dunnos for all. Not a lot has happened since I last posted, but I've gotten requests to at least stay in touch, so here I am.

I suppose the biggest thing that happened to her since my last update was a success in rehab: namely, she managed to make it up the length of the parallel beams on the walking-walkway, even if she still had to hang onto them as best she could while she did it. Her rehab nurse was right beside her the entire time, of course, and it took her quite a while to do it, but she did it herself, without needing any he;lp...and judging from the pride in her voice and face while she was telling me about it later that night, she felt, feels, pretty damn good about it, and I'm proud of her, too. I don't have a lot of experience in rehab work (something I may need to rectify for future needs...), but it doesn't take an expert to realize she's making incredible progress against incredible odds, which just makes me, well, happy. She's been continuing to origami, and is rapidly filling a shoebox so far, having gone through two replacement packs of paper so far as well, and every shape in the book I got her. It's been a good week, all in all. Questions?

### 19727970  ###

> _re: "Just a quick update, you decided you weren't going to rape her, until you adopted her? something like that? it's been a while, anonynurse, it's good to hear from you._

Uh, well, I did decide I wasn't going to rape her. I hadn't really established a post-adoption clause. As it is, I'm working on a few aspects of that (the adoption-y stuff, not the raping) at the moment, but no tremendous progress there just yet.

### 19728171  ###

> _re: "Also, and I am obligated to ask you this -again-, Anonymous requires pics of amputee-chan/pics of something that will convince us that you're a male nurse."_

Well, I took a picture of my scrubs with a wrapped copy of EBA and its reciept that I got her for christmas just before it, but with my posting having 'dried up', it's still waiting to be developed with the rest of my christmas pics.

Again, though, I won't be taking any pictures of her, or if I did, they won't be posted on /b/, in any case. I'm not enough of an attention whore to toss her to the anonymous hordes the way some other people have in the past. Sorry.

### 19729011  ###

> _re: "So, I'm curious. Assuming there is no outside interferense, how long is Ampu-chan supposed to stay at the clinic where you work? I mean, with the old people I can accept the length of "until they die LU­LZ", but how does that work with someone who (conceivably) still has a long time to live?"_

That's the thing, there isn't generally a very well established set of procedures for people in situations like hers. While there are group homes and foster homes that accept disabled children, none of them HAVE to accept them, and when they have problems as serious as she has, they rarely will...and when they do, it rarely goes well. Group homes are run by professionals, and generally know when they can't handle a patient, and thus don't try something they think will fail miserably for them. Foster homes, and I'm talking about good ones here, generally specialize in either mental or physical disabilities, rarely both, and even the most dedicated are rarely up to the level of problems she has.

Sure, she might get accepted into a foster home in time, as her file gets shuffled through the system, and her social worker (who I think is a pretty good one) tries to advocate for her before she burns out...but, and maybe I'm just being pessimistic, the odds of it being a successful transition are sadly low. Not impossible, of course, but...well, not good, either.

Thus, miracles aside, the most likely outcome for someone in her situation will be...staying in institutional care until the age of majority. Another eleven or so years, in her case. Once her physical rehab is considered sufficient, and her psychological progress having advanced further, they may try sending her to school again, arranging for the local 'handi-bus' to ship her to and from it every day. But other than that? Not much would change for her, and the life, which isn't one I'd want to live, she's living at the moment would continue.

Horribly damaged kids aren't feel-good stories, despite what you might think. People don't like thinking about what to do with them, so they tend to disappear into the system, to their disadvantage. Shit sucks, and it isn't likely to stop any time soon, thanks to basic human nature.

Well, I mentioned at the time that I wrote that as satire, but hey, suppose I can't he;lp your being perturbed, though I'm not sure why you'd be angry in particular, guessing you meant disturbed.

Well, consider this: If most people just read on the wiki rather than contributing, then I'm left rambling on in the thread more or less on my own, otherwise just surrounded by flooding fags and dickheads, which leaves me somewhat discouraged. Food for thought, hm?

I don't see anything wrong with being prepared. I'll admit, I still haven't come to a final decision on whether I'm ready or able to adopt and care for her myself...as I've said before, time and time again, I'm not a saint, I'm just, you know, a guy. But even so, gathering all the information I can, on both the process and how eligible to participate in it I'd be, seems like a good thing to do...must be my boy scout background acting up.

I like to think I'm smart enough to avoid contaminating my chances with inappropriate interest...I like to, anyway.

> _re: "On an unrelated note, I'm curious as to how she is interacting with the other nurses now. At the beginning of your tale you mentioned she was mostly silent to practically everyone. Has your influnce extended to her being more sociable in general?"_

She has improved a little with the others, but not dramatically, unfortunately. Even with my attempts to try and smooth things over a bit between my coworkers, and her, I'm still practically on my own with her, so to speak. Unfortunately, having one person you can warm up to and confide in and trust somewhat rarely means that you'll feel that way about everyone else in a similar position, as I'm sure everyone here can relate to, remembering a favorite teacher, or relative, or coworker, or classmate, or whatever.

But the fact that she's gotten better with one person gives one hope that she might get better with more in the future...just need to be patient, and stay optimistic.

### 19732385  ###

> _re: "Continuing this topic, how does she interact with her physical therapist and psychologist?"_

Well, I haven't had the opportunity to actually meet her physical therapists, but from what I've heard through the nursing grapevine on the subject, she's very...committed...to the rehabilitation, but still somewhat short on 'committing' to the nurses involved in it. She isn't outright abusive or anything, but she doesn't seem to have been outright friendly with them, either, more the general way she behaves with almost everyone, even me at times, still: withdrawn, distant, hard to reach. Not 'Rei'-ish and empty, just...withdrawn. It's a pretty common PTSD symptom, particularly in kids...

Anyway, with our resident headshrinker, from what she's told me herself, she's a troublesome patient. Vastly more lucid and 'together' than the majority of her other patients (those being the geriatrics), but at the same time, more difficult to deal with, due to the aforementioned withdrawing and reluctance to open up to others, particularly, it seems, shrinks, which she's had a lot of in the months since the accident. She refuses to even participate in play therapy, for example, and threw the amputee doll that was procured for her, saying it 'wasn't broken enough', as it was only designed with removable legs, her particular level of...damage...not really being common enough to make said dolls to match. In any case...trouble, yes...she's been trying to arrange a setup for her to see some of the pediatric specialists at the hospital again, but navigating the bureaucracy of the companies involved has been hard work, even with some he;lp from her social worker. It's a mess, yes.

Ha, I'll come right out and admit that it was the inspiration for my origami present...I'm just glad it worked out, and that, perhaps, she hasn't seen the series, and thus didn't suspect the origins of my gift.

I generally work six days a week, the 11pm-7am night shift. I have sunday nights off to catch up on sleep and do whatever I like to do, though there's rarely all that much to do on sunday nights, out on the town. She's almost always still awake when I come on duty these days, as she's admitted that she stays up to see me, and because she likes having some time to herself where she isn't surrounded by the moaning almost-dead and such (not her words, exactly). As I've mentioned before, I'm considering talking to her social worker and my bosses about volunteering some of my free time during the day some days to simply spending some time with her outside the nursing relationship, sort of like a 'big brothers/big sisters' relationship for single-parent kids. Still working up the nerve for that proposal.

I generally let her talk about her day, vent about things that've bothered her, talk about the people around her and so on and so forth...acting as a sounding board, mostly, someone to listen to her without writing it up in her file and such, you know? She occasionally asks me about similar things, everyday events, stuff I do, what I think about certain things, etc...it's nice, really, though she is still just a kid, so they aren't the deepest conversations I could have, but they're good ones, and I really don't mind any of them in the least. I'm just happy she's opened up enough to make it a possibility in the first place.

Yes, I have, as I've mentioned, we discussed it at christmas, and a couple of times since. He's having lunch with a friend that works in family law this upcoming week, where he'll discuss the situation in general, and get some advice from a specialist to relay to me, hopefully...

...well, I'm not an ideal candidate, simply for the single-person reason. But as I've pointed out before, she's a 'special' case, and they're less likely to outright reject me than they might for a more 'viable' candidate, all things considered...well, I can only hope, y'know?

## Part Twelve (January 30th) ##


### 19816917 ###

Hey, /b/. I was a bit busy yesterday, and two days in a row seems to be pushing it, so I thought I'd check in today, instead. I finally got off the pot, so to speak, and called up her social worker.

Now, no, I didn't discuss adoption procedures. Rather, we had a conversation about the volunteering of social time outside of work, as I've mentioned considering on here before. Though I phrased it more as a 'mentoring' opportunity, since that's kind of the current hip way of putting it, historical use aside. Turns out that she's handled similar situations before, though not with someone that was also in a professional caretaker role with the 'subject' before...except for a highschool teacher that helped out a troubled but gifted kid, once. Fortunately, that situation went well, so it left her with a somewhat open mind on similar other situations...

### 19817415 ###

So she said that she'd think about it, and check the guidelines for such things, and get back to me. We've established a decent relationship so far, so hopefully she'll bear that in mind and give me a chance, rather than dismissing me out of hand according to some 'general regulations' or some such. I haven't told the head administrator of the home about it yet, since I figured I'd get the social worker's word on whether it's a go/no first, lest I create more trouble than I need to in the first place. So, I'm in for a penny, at least...
Anyway, it wasn't actually too eventful at work last night, but it seems that she had another altercation on sunday. She had been wheeled out to movie night (which she generally tries to get out of, but couldn't avoid this time, it seems; understandable, since most of the actors in said movies are dead or dying by now), and was placed in the back row, since her eyesight, even monoscopic as it is, is still better than any of her fellow residents'.

### 19817812 ###

So, there she was, as the rest of them filed in slowly, playing with her DS with her headphones on, perhaps content to do so for the rest of the evening, minding her own business. Apparently, they were showing 'Above and Beyond', some movie from the 50s about the pilot of the Enola Gay. Yeah, great choice there, but pretty standard fare for that crowd, all in all. Now, that didn't seem to be the problem, necessarily, but that guy I'd mentioned her getting into that first altercation with was there, too, talking with a couple of his friends, and apparently noticing her, and sort of half-senilely getting riled up due to the combination of a movie about nuked japs and her. Being a couple of old-people-from-the-40s racists, his friends didn't do much to calm him up, more the opposite, in fact.

So after a few minutes of this, with the nurses and orderlies on hand working the evening shift, and not having been there for the previous incident or the majority of gossip about it and thus not quite picking up on the combination of agitation and glances her way, he got up and headed toward her again...

### 19818180 ###

Once he got there, she finally looked up, not having noticed him approach with her headphones on and her attention on the game, as he cast a shadow over her. She tugged her headphones up and looked up at him, as he started into a rant-speech about what that night's movie was about, pearl harbor, filthy japs, his dead buddies, how they should've done more than just build camps, how they should've nuked the whole island, etc. It was around this time that the staff started really noticing the situation, though they missed whatever she said back to him (I asked her last night, and she said that she told him how her japanese relatives had been living in the country since before the war started, so they were as american as he was), but it seemed to push a button, and he snatched her DS stylus out of her hand, and shouted something else about Tojo while making a violent gesture her way...

...and she threw the opened apple juice container sitting on the table beside her (on her left, natch) right up into his face. Amazing shot, really, for someone with her depth perception problems.

### 19818322 ###

Well, that's when all hell started breaking loose, of course, and as soon as he'd recovered somewhat he made to lunge at her, and got intercepted by the orderlies. He got escorted out, screaming about her being a slanty-eyed whore, amongst other things, and the rest of the residents were somewhat stirred up themselves by all the excitement, the most of the staff having their hands full trying to calm them up again. It was decided that it'd be for the best to wheel her back to her room rather than 'let her' stay for the movie, which she was just fine with, with one of the orderlies returning her stylus to her in the hallway on the way back, having already gotten him to the room, his partner working on calming him up. I thought it was hilarious when I heard about it in the staff room on monday night before my shift (I generally go in a bit early to catch up on what I missed the day before), threat to her safety aside, but it also dawned on me that it probably didn't get percieved entirely as one-sided with others as it did with me, particularly with her trouble relating with the staff in the past.

### 19818671 ###

Still, they do get that she's just a child, and he was, theoretically, the adult (though with the problems of diminished capacity in so many of our residents, assigning responsibility for anything is always a tricky subject) in the interaction. There's been a more stringent note placed in both their files about trying to keep some distance between them in the future, so hopefully that'll be the end of it...though her ownage of him has been a source of warm fuzzy feelings in me for a while now, as disrespectful of the 'greatest generation' it might be. Ah, well.

I met up with her when I went on shift and we discussed it amongst ourselves, with her perspective being added to the third-party observations (both of them merged in my account here), wherein she admitted that she really didn't mind missing the movie after all, since they're always so boring, to her. Then she offered me an origami racecar, and we played Mario Kart for a while (she direction-pads, I button), before she went to sleep. I did my usual thing with the other patients a few times, then got a call from her again around 4, after she'd had another nightmare...and after I helped console her and calm her up enough to fall asleep again, things were quiet...though I did feel more irritated with him (her 'opponent'), as it seems she'd had a nightmare on sunday night, too, which I wasn't there for, the stress of the incident perhaps fueling the flames...mm, I just hope it'll wear off soon. Well, that's about it, I suppose...

### 19818816 ###

Oh yeah! A question: I just realized today that 4chan has a 'papercraft/origami' area, but when I checked it out earlier today, the first few pages were just papercraft. Is there any origami in there at all? I never had a reason to check it out before, thus my not really realizing it exists (I don't check out food, or weapons, either, so cut me some slack...), so I'd just gotten to thinking about some new shapes I could find for her to try, as she's gone through the book I got her, and most of the other books I've seen in stores just have more or less the same basic ones...

### 19818977 ###

> _Wow, she's getting bolder and bolder. Nice reaction there - any 7yo would rather back out rather then make a direct contact or retaliate with juice projectile. Way to go~!_  
> _As for DS - one question Nurse-kun, how does she play one? Stylus + uses one hand to push buttons/cross at the same time whike pressing the whole DS to her lap, or some other technique? I'm curious._

Yeah, I was proud of her, but it is an unusual reaction for a kid to have...but if you think about it, well, where could she go? She can't wheel her chair around herself, with just the one arm (and her insistance of hating them and stubborn refusal to learn to use it precluding them getting her an electric one, it seems), so she can't retreat like a normal child would, and her issues with 'authority figures' and distance from most of the nurses seems to leave her unwilling or unable to go to them for he;lp...well, it's not a normal reaction, like I said, and if you wanted to be harsh about it, you could write it off as another symptom of her PTSD, the increased aggression with stress in particular. Still, I'm trying to hang onto my 'woo, abuse the elderly!' feeling, here.

As for the DS, she's still just playing stylus-control-based games...she uses her left hand to use the stylus, and her myoelectic right prosthetic arm/hand to hold it steady. She's gotten much better at doing both since before christmas, though she's still learning to do both naturally, of course, particularly as she was right-handed before the accident.

### 19819146 ###

> _Well, I must admit, that this guy has a lot of memories to back up his hate. Along with altzheimer, such things surface and accumulate to abnormal levels, so he snaps and propably WILL snap again.

It'll he;lp her get the tension out -> less tenstion => less nightmares. :3" _  

Well yeah, I can understand his inclinations towards anti-japanese sentiment, as it was pretty universal among people his age during wartime back then...and pretty universally accepted as 'proper', too. So I'm cutting him more slack than I would, say, a neo-nazi, or a KKK member or something (lol, /b/, nigras, shoop da whoop, etc). Still, she's a *seven year old child*. Who isn't even fully Japanese, not that that should really matter at all. Moderate Dementia or no, I can't just write it off entirely. Though I'm not going to be poisoning or roughing him up, either, because a) that's the opposite of my job, and why I got into this job in the first place, and b) he wouldn't even understand why it was happening in the first place, so it'd be pointless. I've been trying not to think about it too much, since it pisses me off to do so, good feelings about her kicking ass aside.

### 19819203 ###

> _From my somewhat limited knowledge, there's rarely any origami posted there at all. Those folks just loooove the papercraft._  
> _On that note though, have you considered introducing a few other crafts to her? She sounds like a bright little kid so I'm sure she'd appreciate different challenges._

Mm, I've thought about it...but I'm not a very craft-oriented person. I mean, I'd never even been in a hobby store before I bought that origami paper for her, it's just never been my thing (and I was just lucky a store at the local mall had it, rather than going across town for it). Any suggestions there, /b/? Bear in mind, her lack of depth perception combined with her one-handedness makes a lot of manual dexterity-requiring projects difficult with her, and it takes her a while even with the origami to figure out the more complex 3-d folds, holding it right up close and turning it this way and that before getting a handle on it...

### 19819566 ###

> _Have you considered buying her one of those gba>SD card carts and loading up some movies for her? You could discuss the movies. _  
> _Protip: Avoid amputation films like Kill Bill. _  

Hm, I never really checked them out before, as I haven't ever really needed to use my DS for such things. What's their capabilities and general costs?

(Also, thanks for the protip, saved me from an embarassing presentation of Blade!)

### 19819665 ###

> _I tought similar - her reaction is somewhat in the pstd area, stressor of the sittuation still percieved as not strong enough to tackle the typical behaviour.

> _As for DS, that's fabulous that she's finally interacting with an object through the prostetic! She's making such progress... ;_;_

Well, I'm not a PTSD specialist by any means, though I've been reading up on it and discussing it with our resident shrink since mid-december or so, now. I can only do my clumsy best to try and avoid doing unintentionally hurtful things, try to do helpful ones, and hope for the best. And yeah, the first night, when I offered the use of my DS, she was really frustrated by her inability to hold it steady with her prosthetic as much as her still clumsiness with her left hand on the stylus...she's gotten a lot better with both since then, and even her hand-rehab nurse sent along a note saying it was a good idea, as she'd told her about it...it's nice to have a good idea every now and then.

### 19819716 ###

> _I almost hope this is all true, just to know there's someone out there like this._

I'm sorry, but as I've said in the past, I just can't risk a picture of her in here, for a number of reasons...amongst them, well, while I know it may be the /b/-tard way to give up pictures of naked girlfriends and sisters and MILFs and strangers and anything else that'll get them some attention, I just can't do that to her. Guess I'm just a bleeding cunt, you know?

### 19820064 ###

> _Check him out for altzheimer. "Moderate dementia" sounds funny for the described actions compared to patients background. Altzheimer surfaces hard written memories of highly intensive emotional fluxes from early days. Thus, his snapping about at "japanese girl" with Pearl Harbour mentioned, sound more like the altzheimer diagnosed patients I have met. And - as altzheimer also intensifies some reactions that center on the mentioned events, it modulates the perception of reality so to speak, so he actually feels closer to his memories then the curent situation. Summing up - that's not anything close to KKK/neonazis, he's propably closer to the emotional memories of his budies dying from wartime events, then natural perception of things they are now. Just clarifing, since I had been forcibly in quite the altzheimer-related subject for last several years. _

Er, right, it's just that I can't recall his exact diagnosis, off-hand, since he's not in my wing, and I thus don't have access to his file...I just went with 'dementia' more as a layman's catch-all term for 'old person crazy' rather than going out on a limb with a specific altzheimer's declaration, since I'm not sure about it. But yes, his behaviour has struck me as being more inclined that way based on some of my other patients, was just 'playing it safe'. Of course, I'm not involved in his care, so I can't make any recommendations in that regard, and the other nurses said he's being looked over more carefully after these incidents, aside from keeping him away from her, so...not a lot I can do, really.

### 19820574 ###

Ok, to this latest barrage of demands for picskthx, I'll say what I've said before: it's not going to happen, and if that somehow drives you to believe or disbelieve something, well, not much I can do about that.
Besides, she's made it clear in the past that she doesn't enjoy, or want, her picture being taken, and doing so while she's asleep is a bit too much of a violation for me (haha, violation, etc etc).

### 19821117 ###

Well...I don't play go. And I don't know if anyone else in the home plays go, either. I suppose I could try it, though...is go appropriate for someone her age? Like, difficulty-wise? She's a damn smart kid, but I don't want to introduce something that'll annoy her one way or another.

### 19822038 ###

> _even little kids play go in japan. she's a smart kid, she can easily learn from a beginner's book. It's too bad tho that she can't play even on the internet. well, give her a book or 2 and she'll be teaching you in no time._

Ok, ok, we'll see. I'll think about it, all right? I was more worried about my not being able to put up a good challenge to her than her being able to get it, if you want the truth.

Mm, yeah...she hasn't said anything about it, but it is amongst her pile of games that don't (as far as I know) get played anymore...I haven't brought it up yet, but then, I haven't brought up her copy of Castlevania: DOS, either...playing Mario Kart together is hard enough.

Well, if the mentoring thing does get the a-ok, I'll bring it up to her as what it is...a choice for her to make, whether she'd like the opportunity to get out of the facility and have some fun, do some things other than going to rehab and coming back, basically, do something other than the routine, with me. If she doesn't want to, well, that'll be that, and I'll drop it, of course...I mean, it's hardly productive to force her to do something to make her happy, right?

Heh, I'll consider going out for pizza on the list, if the mentoring thing goes through. Bringing food into the home from outside is a no-no, though.

### 19822894 ###

> _You wouldn't happen to have the wifi friend code dealie for her MK:DS, would you? :0_

Hm, no, I don't...the home isn't wi-fi equipped, anyway, so she wouldn't be able to play with anyone from outside...besides, if she got randomly buzzed by someone she doesn't know to play, it might not go very well, you know? Sorry, mang.

> _one armed ball of cuteness_

Well, since she's closer to approaching a roughly spherical-ish set of limbs than the vast majority of humans, she might not, well, not just yet, anyway. ...doesn't mean she isn't, though.

Anyway: it's been a while now, and a hectic while at that, since I went through her family's things with her social worker...I was kind of focused on finding the DS & games in particular, and it was dark and we were rushed (she wanted to get home, having gone out there with me as her last task of the day, and it took her into overtime without extra pay), so I didn't really have the time to analyze her belongings when we finally found her boxes. I seem to recall that she had a stuffed lion in one box, but since we came for the DS in particular, I wasn't comfortable enough requesting to add it to the list, since I was kind of pushing it as it was...any music or movies were packed with the rest of the family's media stuff, since most 7 year olds don't keep those things in their own rooms, and I've mostly replaced her music collection via her new iPod, anyway...and to be honest? My memory isn't really all that great, anyway. Maybe I'll bring it up with her, but for now, that's all I can offer.

Summer.

She may no have the full tendencies of all the Mouth-breathing Otaku here... but just keep it to a minimum. If you are going to encourage her w/ board games start w/ checkers and then move up to the like._

I know. I've born that in mind, and it's not TOO hard to do so, since she speaks with a local accent, has the blonde hair, and is 'clearly' a local girl, too, though I admit that I'm not really sure how a japanese girl would be different in that regard, since I've not really met one (from Japan) before. I like to think I'm not an otaku, or at least I'd be a self-loathing one if I were, though I don't really outright loathe them, either...I mean, anyone that's a regular on 4chan can't really claim to be completely incompatible with them, or they'd be hanging out somewhere else.

Rambling. Anyway...yeah, I know. The origami is the most japanese thing I've introduced to her so far, and while the go suggestion was a good one, as it's not a bad game and easily played one-handed between two people, I think I might try checkers and/or chess, first, simply because I know them better. Really, if I tried to go too 'wapanese' on her, I'd just embarass myself, since I don't even speak the language or anything...even a local girl like her (who can) can detect that stink of desperation, one would think.

### 19827743 ###

> _So Nurse-Kun, what was the impetus that started this 4chan Illiad?_  
> _Really, what posessed you to weave your epic tale of love, compassion, and no-legged loli's?_

Well...the simple fact is that I didn't really have anyone else with whom I could talk about the situation in a frank manner. Amputee or orphan or whatever-specific sites don't quite have /b/'s level
of...brutal...honesty, and I might've just been kicked out or tracked up, 4chan's anonymity (we are not anonymous, lol) being another selling point. I took a gamble that there were at least a few anonymii on here that weren't total shitbags, since I don't think I am, and I'm on here, so...well, it turned out more positively than I'd thought it would, so I think it was for the best. Then it kinda snowballed from there, with interest levels I really wasn't anticipating, and, well, here we are.

Hm, I'll consider this. I'm actually looking across the room at something that would suffice right now...

### 19829187 ###

> _Well, a rock would work. You can't have two rocks that'rye the same._

Well, what it is doesn't really matter, since I still don't have a digital camera medium. So it'll need to be developed, even if I do take one. Besides, it is kinda unfeasible without said digital medium for quick uploading, so...it's never been my thing to consider that sort of thing before, not sure I want to now. I'll think about it.

### 19829754 ###

I have no interest in having a tripcode. Just for the record. If I do decide to pick up a cheapo webcam or something, I may consider the aforementioned 'unique items' method of identification, but that'd be about it.

> _You could probably borrow a few origami books from a library or photocopy them. Does she like to draw? Or maybe you could get her some modeling clay to mess around with, that stuff is all fun._

It seems she did like to draw, before the accident...pretty talented, too, as our friendly neighbourhood shrink has some photocopies of pictures she did pre-accident, donated to her psych team at the hospital by her teachers. I'm not an art expert or anything, but I would've judged them done by someone quite a bit older than her, and done well, too...and all of it nice, happy, well-adjusted stuff...including pictures of her parents, which were 'realistic' enough to give me a good idea of how they looked. Not so much since, though...the resident shrink has some copies of pictures she did as part of her therapy, and...well...it's some disturbing shit.

And I say that as a /b/tard. It was probably the most sick I've felt in regards to her...not because she grossed me out, but...well, I'm going to sound like a pussy faget assorted adjective nouns saying this, but...it was the realization of just how badly she's been damaged, if the pictures are any indication of her psyche...mm...anyway...

I'm not sure about knitting, don't you need two hands with decent finger control to do that? I guess I could look into it. And yeah, I've considered checking the local library for more origami books, though that website someone pointed me toward earlier has some good stuff in it, too. I'll think about the clay, too.

### 19831085 ###

> _maybe needle-point, if she's not a 'staby-staby' risk... if she can use her prosthetic hand/arm to hold it, should be pretty easy. probably wouldn't even need a thimble._

Well, she's still considered risky enough that sharp objects would probably be ruled out by the administrators/shrink. That might include knitting needles.

### 19831899 ###

> _"become an hero" risky, or "needles in Angry-Vet's applesauce" risky?_

Well, geez, man, if I let her on /b/, assuming I got her to a computer where it wasn't blocked in the first place, I'd get banned for underaged posting if she said anything.

More seriously, she's seven years old, dude. /b/ is not a place for seven year olds to be, already messed up or not (perhaps especially not them).

Less seriously, to follow up on the more serious point: If your cat could read and comprehend, would you let it read 'StuffOnMyCat.com' after having posed it with a catgirl figurine on it while it was asleep?

### 19830651 ###

> _So Nurse-kun, another question, and this time it's in complete digression from the Amputee-chan topic. _  
> _How'd you come to be a /b/rother?_

Uh, it's not a very interesting story. A friend of mine linked some pictures from 4chan, I checked them out, looked into the whole 4chan thing, wound up in /b/, found it amusing, kept checking back. The End.
It's not exactly the mythic quest of the ages, y'know?

As I said, that's why I came to /b/ with this in the first place. I mean, if anyone was going to tell me 'lol shes fucked', it would be /b/. Thus far, that remains a minority opinion.

### 19831440 ###

> _How does Amputee-chan take to books?_

Quite well. She's been reading relatively steadily since christmas, when me/the family got her a whole box of them, and I'm considering talking to a librarian for advice on further items pretty soon, as she's been going through said box at a rapid pace...one can only play so much DS, after all.

### 19831880 ###

> _You know if you adopt her, one day she will have hormones, and she won't have many friends. You are going to be the manliest guy in her life by a serious amount. Sticking it in her pooper isn't too unrealistic._

I'm trying not to think about that too much, dude. But, at the same time, something I couldn't he;lp thinking about, bad as it may be...another question for /b/ here, and give it to me straight.

Would you be interested in a girl/woman missing three limbs and an eye, even if she used her arm prosthesis really well, covered up her leg prosthetics with stockings or something and was good enough with them to walk or even run almost normally, was good enough with makeup to cover the scar over her eye...? Excluding 'god stumps maek me hard' answers from the sickos out there, asking the non-fetishests here...would you be romantically interested in someone like her, with a great body (that's still intact) and a more or less healed psyche and a fascinating mind? And not just romantically, but sexually, as well?

Think hard about this, /b/, and in particular, think back to when you were a teenager/onward...be honest with yourselves before you answer. It's not something I enjoy thinking about, but it came up after someone posted a similar question in an earlier thread, and it occasionally pops back up in my brain...stuff like this is part of why I came to /b/ with her in the first place, he;lp me out here.

### 19832598 ###

Just for the record here...I'm not asking 'Should *I* go for it?'. Question isn't about if it's ok for me to feel that way, it's a solicitation of thought from others on a hypothetical girl in her situation when they're of age, or at least a teenager with 'you' being of the same age as her, etc.

### 19833789 ###

Well...I'll say this much: we're not in the ass-crack of America, and you can take from that what you will. We aren't in one of the cosmopolitan centers, but we aren't in podunkville, either. Still...I'd say that people are no better or worse than anywhere else, really...and with that, all the good and bad things that suggests.

Never been my style, I must admit. I mean, I always sort of saw them as the refuge of those that are desperately seeking a way to make the world recognize their awesomeness that everyone they meet up close seem to miss. Or at least cyber cocksuckings.

Yeah, I know. I mean, I never anticipated it growing into this, so the whole 'watch what you say on...THE INTERNETS' voice wasn't speaking to me at the time. I mean, shit, I didn't even know there was a 4chan wiki before all this, let alone that it'd all wind up archived on one...

## **Part Thirteen (February 13th)**  ##


### 20480580  ###

Hey, /b/. I know it may seem like it's been a while, but I tried posting last tuesday afternoon: the tread died without a single response, while I was writing the third entry or so. After that rather blunt statement of how welcome it was at the time, I didn't try again until sunday, when 4chan seems to have been down, and I gave up. Anyway, I figured I'd give it one more go for now, and I guess we'll see what happens

### 20480758  ###

Anyway, I suppose I'll recap with last week's updates first, though I don't really feel like going into the detail I did back then, just in case it dies a quick death again. My lawyer cousin had lunch with a friend of his that works in family law, and got his advice on someone in my/her/our situation, and the viability of guardianship in said situation. Apparently, I'd have a considerably better chance with her than I would with a healthy, well-adjusted kid, which is kind of sad in a way, suggesting 'well, nobody else wants her, you'll do, I guess' or something. Still, it's good news, for the simple fact that it suggests that it's quite possible, rather than a miracle being required. His friend even gave my cousin his card to give to me, and said he might be interested if I do pursue the matter, so I have it in my wallet right now.

### 20481173  ###

I also went to her social worker, and then to the head administrator at the home, with my idea on mentoring her on my own time. Since I had the resident shrink's approval and recommendation of it being a good idea (in theory, anyway), I felt a bit more confident about doing so, and, well, did. Her social worker seemed to take me seriously, and said that she'd consider the possibility, having worked with a number of other such programs in the past, though not with someone in her/my particular situation. But she admitted that it was a somewhat unique one, so strange arrangements might be necessary. So, it was a somewhat positive 'I'll think about it' from her, anyway. My boss (the administrator, I guess 'boss' is easier than typing out that 13 letter word every time) was a bit less welcoming of the idea, first point blank asking me if I was even sure I wanted to really suggest doing this, then when I said that I was, and offering up the shrink and social worker's varying levels of approval (pending or otherwise), she said that she'd think about it as well...and check with the facility/company's lawyers on the subject. Since I'd been thinking about this for a while, I'd asked my cousin to bring up this situation with his friend as well, and he'd said that he didn't see anything that'd condemn it, though he admitted that I'd probably have to expect being watched by a hawk by my 'own' legal-types; I'd expected this, since it only makes sense that they would, so it wasn't a big surprise. Anyway, final talley with my boss: Maybe, with a capital M. Better than no!

### 20481431  ###

As for you-know-who herself, she'd had more nightmares than usual (which for her, means every night, rather than every two or three nights) since the incident with the geriatric superman. This made me somewhat angry, since she'd been a bit better before then, but it's not like I was going to do anything to him, so all I could do was be there for her. I've been printing out online instructions for origami (she now has a small army of multicolored penguins gathered around her bedside lamp), and I got her a copy of 'Cooking Mama', too, which she seems to be enjoying. Seems she used to 'he;lp out' with her parents when they'd make dinner pre-accident, so it's nice in that way...though she got a bit depressed when she told me about that at the time. It was only a temporary state of affairs, thankfully, and as I said, has been enjoying it since. (I suck at it when I try it left-handed with her, but then, I'm not much of a whiz in the kitchen in real life, either.)

### 20481890  ###

There hasn't been an astounding amount happening in the week since last, with all the previous stuff I just mentioned having happened since then (except for Cooking Mama, which I got her last thursday), which may be a good thing, I suppose, in some ways. A bit of peace is hardly detrimental to recovery in general, and her nightmare/stresses factor has dwindled, to the point where she's more or less back to her 'normal' set of affairs...having one last night, after not having one on sunday, for example. Ah, well... I did hear back from the social worker, however, yesterday. She gave her probationary approval to set up some sort of mentoring plan, pending approval from my boss, of course. I haven't managed to talk to her about it yet, but I did send her an email on the subject and the worker's approval, so hopefully things will progress on that front as well. I haven't actually spoken to the girl at the center of this rigamarole yet, because I didn't want to get her hopes up (if she would even want it to happen at all, really...) only to have them dashed later; even if I get approval for all this, I still need to ask her if she's even interested...if she isn't, well, it stops there, I suppose.

### 20481996  ###

In any case, other than all that, nothing really big has happened with her...it's been a decent, peaceful week so far, so, um, that's about it, really...open to questions as usual, but that's about all I can pry out of my own recollections for the time being. So, um, yeah.

### 20482600  ###

The System, which was set up to protect the kids nobody else was caring about, in the wake of charity-run institutions that couldn't keep up with a population boom, increasing urbanization, and an increased set of protections for children from dying in factories and chimneys and such. Sometimes, it has to hurt you to show it cares, you know.

![nurse-kun had requested this image.](Contrabandv2.jpg)

### 20482738  ###

Awesome. Thanks, both of you, I really hadn't expected such a fast response, let alone two of them. And to answer the question in the first of the two posts...well, if it does happen, things in my life will change...almost completely, I'd imagine. I mean, I'd probably have to find a bigger place to live that's close to the various facilities she needs; I'd need to quit my job to take care of her full time; I'd need the he;lp of my family more than I do now, though I'm not estranged from them or anything, just, you know, a grownup. Dating prospects would probably be pretty rocky for a while at least, though I'm not a total lothario as it is, really. I could go on, but...well, it'd be a sea change. I have a feeling it might be worth it all, though, but I suppose I can't know that till I live it.

### 20482950  ###

>  _"Well all love you nurse-kun, do your best. We all support you and will suck your cock if you dress her as suisekei and then post pics."_

Well, to be fair, she does have the Boku hair at the moment, and seems more comfortable with stabbiness than a watering can right now...um, no promises.now...um, no promises.

### 20483563  ###

>  _"How much money would you get from the government to help care for her?"_

Probably enough to cover expenses, though I doubt I'd be retiring anytime soon, or buying her a pony (not that she'd have much use for one, at least at the moment...). There's also the settlement from the family/estate/whatever of the guy that hit her family's car. Anyway, we wouldn't be facing life in a cardboard box in an alleyway somewhere after a string of medical costs or something, at least...no nanahood for her.

### 20483699  ###

>  _"Will you consider buttesecks with her once she is legally yours and that the vultures of administration forget about you?"_

It seems rather unlikely, old chum. I won't rule it out completely, lest I lose my /b/adge entirely, but unlikely, yes.

### 20484111  ###

>  _"speaking of nana, have you considered getting her to dye her hair that way?"_

Okay, I'll be honest: I've never actually seen Elfen Lied. I've never been much of a guro fan, even horror movies, really, which might be considered funny, I guess, considering my stint as an ER nurse working on trauma cases. Still, there it is. I did finally read through NEL, like, a month or two ago, since people kept making so many references to it, but...yeah, I don't have a particularly large Nana fetish. Does she actually die in the series? Because I've seen the screencaps of her laying there with her limbs sliced off, and that's a fair amount of blood, and...that's about the extent of my knowledge. Whole thing just seemed too depressing for me (which may also be considered funny, I guess.).

### 20484195  ###

>  _"Souseiseki is much cooler anyway. If she weren't, we wouldn't like your stories so much."_

Well, I've always thought so, too. Of course, she is extremely intelligent and used to play the violin at a prodigy-type level, too, but she's too cool to be cast as Kanaria...no egg fetish, either.

### 20484248  ###

And, uh, yes, I guess I just outed myself as a Rozen-fag (mild, I assure you) that isn't a guro/Elfen Lied fan. Some /b/tard I am. How embarassing.

### 20484290  ###

>  _"You should buy amputan some of the GBA Final Fantasy ports, they're easy to play one handed, as I'm sure all of /b/ knows."_

I suppose they would be, at that, though I haven't tried them myself..are they good ports, or PSX-level shitty ones? They are a bit before her time, so I guess they'd be new to her, too...good recommendation, anonymous.

### 20484387  ###

>  _"Does amputan have a TV in her room?"_

No. None of the patients do, due to some regulation that's never been explained to me in a way that makes much sense, but which probably exist just as a method of control. You'd be surprised what you can get away with in a 'care' facility that you can't in a hospital room someone is only going to be living in temporarily. The only tvs are in the rec rooms and other public gathering areas (which are guaranteed never to be showing something she'd like to watch, so she's given up on trying, last I'd heard...)

### 20484500  ###

>  _"Elfen Lied is overrated. Nana doesn't die, she lives happily ever after."_

...seriously? Geez, I never expected that outcome, I'll admit. Maybe I do still have the requisite /b/astardlyness

### 20484869  ###

>  _"A 1-handed DS is perfectly viable if you disregard stylus useage. The package would be considerably thicker due to some reroutes, but definitely doable. I would be proud to engineer this for Nurse-kun."_

Huh. But then, most of her favorite games use the stylus, and most of the best games (in my experience) use it as well. Would it be 'deactivated' somehow if it were altered? And I can't ask for that, certainly not now, anyway...I'd need to discuss it with her, first, anyway, and we'd need to come up with a spare DS, in any case. But all that said, I still appreciate the thought, like I appreciate all the (positive) thoughts people offer.

### 20484957  ###

>  _"much of the humour of the series comes from her attempts at coming to terms with her new artificial limbs.though she has an easier time than most quadra paraplegics due to her being able to control these artificial limbs using the power of her mind."_

Huh, so she's actually in the show beyond the part where she loses her limbs? When I'd heard discussions in the past, nobody ever mentioned her past that point, it was all just about Lucy, or Nyuu, or whoever the other horned girl is, so I got the impression Nana wasn't a recurring character. Learn something new all the time.

And yeah, mind/superpowered-controlled limbs would be nice, I'd imagine, considering the alternatives.

### 20485113  ###

>  _"Let her play (Final Fantasy)5 and 6, 6 being the best. They're very lengthy games, and very fun with a good story. Especially 6, even though the super nonlinear second half could turn off little kids."_

I know, man, I played VI (III) when I was a kid, myself. Well, older than she is now, but still a kid, all in all. Geez, I feel old now. Anyway, yeah, I'll consider them.

### 20485901  ###

>  _"You should find out if she likes animu or other tv shows. She may have been following a series before her accident or something. Even if she can't have a TV, you could probably get a portable DVD player or something. the prices are lower now. Also, show her Rozen maiden as a precursor to making her dress up as boku."_

I've thought about it, particularly since she's fluent in the language, and seems to have been somewhat internet savvy and such. I'll bring it up to her, I suppose, I was just a bit worried about her feeling 'stereotyped' somehow, like 'hey, you're half-japanese, you must LOVE anime, right?' or something.

### 20486045  ###

That aside, I have to say I've been following this whole saga since it started, and despite the fact I'm a /b/tard, tred and true, seeing how much YOU'VE changed over the course of these months is definately interesting. You went from someone who wanted to simply stick it in a loli's pooper to someone who has actually grown to care for this girl and I think you would make a great father for her if it works out for you. But seriously, the BUTTSEX? After chicks see what a caring guy you are, they'll be begging you for BUTTSEX. Stick to them and keep being the person that amputee-chan needs."_

Well, I could protest and get into the whole 'I was joking' thing, but that'd probably just prompt fifty posts or so from people quoting old posts at me or something. So I'll take your post in the spirit it was intended, and thank you...and yeah, I haven't given up all hope for future romantic relationships should the adoption go through...yet. And huh, I didn't know that she remained a main character and such, and as someone else earlier said, they use her getting used to prosthetics in the story...might have to check it out, now. Hm.

Anyway, I need to afk for 10-20 minutes or so now, hopefully the thread will still be alive when I get back.

Well, it's certainly a teamwork thing. But yeah, she takes the left side of the DS, I take the right, and we do our best. She does have priority in the braking/accelerating command structure, though she doesn't tell me when to do each and every one, but occasional outbursts of 'brakes!' or 'power slide!' (Multi-track drifting!?!) will escape her lips. Oh, and she tells me who to shell or when to banana, and such, too.
It's a lot of fun, actually, reminds me of playing the original mario kart with my brother, way back when. We may not be ready for any international tournaments yet, but we've steadily gotten better, and I see no reason that trend won't continue! (There's an idea...a Mario Kart themed picture...)

Well, I'd probably wind up moving, but yes, I've considered that. I could probably write it off on my taxes, at least, but I'd get better advice than just that before I went ahead with it.

>  _"Get her another one of those chocolate oranges"_

Hm. I'll consider it. Might be seasonal, though.

### 20491815  ###

>  _"Also, how much time will you have to spend with her? If being a nurse in the States is anything like being a nurse here, you'll be leaving home early and coming back late."_

Well, as I've said previously: if it goes through, I'll very likely have to quit my job to look after her full time. But people adopting kids (particularly those with serious problems) are given compensation to take care of them, along with various other sources it should be enough.

### 20491865  ###

>  _"So Nurse-kun, when you do finally adopt her, you are gonna post her picture on /b/, right? There would be no harm in that, she would be your daughter then. DO IT."_

Well, we'll see then, won't we?

### 20492377  ###

>  _"That would be totally fuckawesome. I can't say that quitting a job would be a wise move, but in this case it would be worthwhile"_

Well, there's always work out there for a nurse. Always. I could be in a hospital, a clinic...only reason I'm in the 'home' is because I chose to go there, for personal reasons I don't really want to get into right now...anyway, it's not as much of a problem as it is for some sort of corporate professional or something. Besides, assuming things go well, she'll keep progressing, and eventually require less fulltime care, go back to school, etc...nothing is forever, right?

## Part Thirteen B (February 13th)  ##


### 20495315  ###

Hey, /b/. Thread died while I was away making some late dinner, figured I'd start another just in case anyone has anything else to say or ask. Go ahead, if you like, or, well, post just about anything that seems related?

### 20495875  ###

> _:3_  
> _Can she make the :3 face?_

Yes, and she occasionally does so (well, a natural :3 face, a bit of a smirk, not a forced lip-twisting one) when she beats me at DS. It is as cute as one would think it to be.

### 20496334  ###

> _Oh awesome, I actually caught a Nurse-Kun thread for once._ _Anyway man - does she talk at all about what happened to her to cause her loss of limbs? I would assume she doesn't like talking about it at all._ _Does she talk at all about growing up using prosthetics?_

No, she never talks about the accident, or her time in the hospital immediately afterward.
She does occasionally talk about her future, but it usually isn't very pleasent conversation...she's very negative, and often says that she doesn't HAVE a future, that she'll be dead soon too, that nothing matters, that nobody cares, etc...I generally tell her that I care at that point, and it usually causes her to stop talking and look away, and the subject gets changed soon afterward. The resident shrink has said that her talking about it at all, even if it's nothing positive, is still a good thing, so I don't discourage it, but it's painful to see and hear her doing so...I'm not an expert in reading people, but it sure looks and sounds to me like she believes it.

It's more rare for her to talk about her prosthetics at all, except for the occasional recounting of her therapy that day, or asking me to he;lp her get 'into' them to do something or another (usually for her DS).

### 20496539  ###

> _Im the guy who said to find out what shows she liked before the crash._
> _Would it be feasible to get her some DVDs? I had to go and missed your reply._

Well, it might be, but she doesn't really have anything to watch them on at the moment. Maybe if the other suggestion on a portable DVD player pans out, but not much for the time being. Could bring in my laptop some evening, but the home frowns on our bringing in electronics in general, laptops no exception at all, I'd assume.

### 20496654  ###

> _Nurse-kun, I have to know. Has amputan been getting out of shape during her hospital stay? Is she losing her gymnast figure? Is she exercising? Can she pop a walnut with her abs?_

Well, her rehab keeps her in pretty good shape, she does supplementary exercises at the home in the day, and she doesn't eat all that much, really...so she's at a 'healthy' weight, at least. She does still have a 7 year old's metabolism too, of course.

### 20496738  ###

> _-in reply to 20496334- Okay. I know that mindset I've had people close to me go through serious depression and that sort of , nobody cares stage. I'm thankfull that at least you are there to support her when she gets to questioning herself._

Yeah, it's a relatively common outlook for kids her age with PTSD, apparently, according to the shrink. Moreso than could be considered 'normal', of course, but somewhat understandable if you put yourself in her shoes, too, unfortunately...

### 20496911  ###

> _What's she doing about the school she's missing? Does she do any homework in her room or is she missing time from school while she's in rehabilitation?_

The latter. There isn't really as much of a system in place for someone in her situation as there should be, perhaps, since it won't cover/can't handle a private tutor, and nobody on staff is qualified to teach her, and she was at some non-public school for the gifted before the accident, so the link between the Public School System and the Family Services System isn't there to facilitate things...

...so at the moment, she's just...not being educated in much of anything, other than the rehab.

### 20498162  ###

> _Yeah that's what I've been wondering._ _I'm sure you're sick to death of hearing it but the way you talked about her early on and the suppository chapter were worrying. Hopefully you just didn't think it through before posting._ _She's traumatized enough without being sexually abused by the only person she trusts. I'm sure you don't want to harm her but it's hard to know what to make of the situation._

As I've said numerous times, the suppository 'story' was written as satire of all those 'Man, I totally just fucked this woman/little girl' erotic copypastas. Since I'm not much of a Writer, I guess that didn't come through clearly to you. Sorry, I guess.

### 20498622  ###

> _Nurse-kun! Hi, I'm studying nursing in Rutgers University and I'd like to tell you that you're my hero. Your story really inspired me to pursue my profession. I'm only in my first year in a 4 year program and I'd like to know how clinicals are and stuff. Oh, and any more advice for nursing school?_

Be sure you really want to do it. Because unlike some of the other low-paying treated-like-shit but-get-to-he;lp-people jobs out there, cops and paramedics, you don't get the authority thrill, get to beat people up (not suggesting all cops are in it for that, just fringe benefits) get to drive a speeding flashing sirening ambulance or get the adrenaline rush of saving a life on the scene. There aren't a lot of fringe benefits, other than the occasional patient that thanks you for helping them when they needed it. If you can handle all that, and you're still interested, then I'm sure you'll make a fine nurse. ...and if you aren't, you can always go back to school later and try being something else, so hey.

Personally, I'd say good for you, and welcome to the fraternity (in a non-gender way).

The first thing any /b/tard would think when they see a loli would be "rape plz ing hawt" from being on /b/ so much and never really dealing with kids, but when you realise the actual situation it become different._ _Eh, I can't explain that well._

Ah, yes, that may not be the best idea, considering the amount of chemicals scattered throughout the home. But, um, booby-traps, you say? I'm entirely sure I want to come in one night and hear about the morning shift nurse coming in to check on her and getting hoisted up to the ceiling by her ankle via improvised IV tubes-rope or something.

No, still no word from her family. Well, her relatives. And she's interacting about the same as she was before, though she had a small incident last week when one of her day nurses dropped her DS (well, bumped it off her desk), and she had a minor freakout about whether it was broken, which involved some insulting language.

Yes, she had friends, no, they don't visit her anymore. I've been told she lashed out a fair bit and burned a lot of bridges post-accident when they showed up, and kids don't tend to like dealing with disfigurations, even if they're gifted little angels, even if parents don't like to admit it, or that they don't particularly like such people either. I guess. Not a shrink myself. Gotta go now. Night, /b/!

## Saving the story

A (non)Danish anon known as Sarafan followed the threads in real time as the story unfolded, and worked tirelessly to save the story for future generations.

The threads were documented in real time on Wikichan, where it was dubbed "Damaged Goods". However after a server crash, all of the fanart was lost and the story was almost lost forever. Thankfully, Shii managed to save the entirety of the wikipages beforehand, until his website was itself shut down.

The original threads were uploaded to temporary download sites where they were soon lost, but Sarafan had a long-lost archive with everything in it up his sleeve. The Bibliotheca Anonoma discovered [Sarafan's complete 4chan thread archive](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22186524/Wikichan-Damaged-Goods-Archive.7z) out of serendipity, 2 days before Megaupload's infamous takedown. 

And from there, we have created the **Remastered Edition**, restoring the story to it's original glory.

## Reactions

<img align="right" src="lolied.jpg" width="200px">

His /b/ threads have become 4chan legend, and his legacy is heavily debated to this day. The two or three hundred replies his posts receive in each thread fall into roughly one of seven categories:

1. I don't Habeeb it!
2. You are a sick, sick fuck. Spam mode activated.
3. Your story warms my heart.
4. Your story inspires my life.
5. Your story inspires my life because I am a Pedophile.
6. ???
7. PROFIT!

### A Challenge to Nurse-kun

On December 14, 2007, Shii received an anonymous tip from a professional statistician who was convinced Nurse-kun's story was fake. In the United States, car accidents are tabulated in a national database called the Fatality Analysis Reporting System|http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx (FARS). You can go to the FARS database yourself and query their results for 2006 and 2005. Very few children were extracted from cars. The guy claimed he couldn't find anyone matching Nurse-kun's description at all. Use the database yourself and see if you can determine Nurse-kun's home state. 

* <s>Case 28-441 in 2005 (Coil Town, Mississippi). 3 occupants, 2 deaths. 5-year-old girl extracted from car with an incapacitating injury and taken to hospital. Currently living. Crash occurred July 24, 2005.</s> Ruled out, this was a single father and two children.
* <s>Case 54-188 in 2005 (Charleston, West Virginia). 3 occupants, 2 deaths. 5-year-old girl extracted from car with an incapacitating injury and taken to hospital. Currently living. Crash occurred July 21, 2005.</s> Ruled out: 

> Comment by C. Reed: (regarding case 54-188: the mother did not die) "Man and toddler die in crash; 5-year old child injured" ... Anyway, if the story was true, there would be news reports about it somewhere given that local news will report on every fatal car wreck.

And indeed, it was.

### Nurse-kun in DC

Comment by J. Stone: *I believe I have found out the location of nurse-kun and ampu-tan I am 90% sure that they are located somewhere around Washington DC.*

> For the first outing in chapter 16 they went to the Kennedy Center for Performing arts (Which in 1992 was renovated to be more handicapped accessible) The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum I am not that sure about the library though.  
> Next in chapter 19 for the hockey game they went to the Version center which hosts the Washington Capitols.  
> And finally in chapter 21 when they went on their walk it was at the Tidal Basin and or West Potomac Park which as Nurse-kun stated is usually packed with people watching the cherry blossoms bloom. 

## Characters

### Nurse-kun

<img align="right" src="nurse-kun.jpg" width="300px">

> “...I did kind of... want to help her.
> I thought about the alternative: I could, of course, do nothing.
> She would be my patient, and I would be her nurse.
> A very professional relationship, but...
> What would become of her?”
> *— Nurse-kun*

A young registered nurse, he sees life in it's worst everyday. As a professional he deals with it as it comes along, but that was before he saw her. Now with a yearning to help beyond the call of duty, he continues to provide support for a fragile life.

Obviously, he was an active user of 4chan, but not a lot is known about him since he keeps his anonymity for security and safety purposes. He does tell us that he's in his twenties and is a male registered nurse who works at a nursing home during the late shift.

### Amputee-chan ###

> I have no future. Nobody wants me anymore.
> *- Amputee-chan*

Amputee-chan is the adopted child of the anon known as Nurse-kun.
According to his story she is half-Norwegian, half-Japanese, blond, green eyed, and missing both legs above the knees due to a car crash. She is also missing her right arm below the elbow. With her immediate family dead, and her relatives leaving her for dead, she has been abandoned in a nursing home as a ward of the state.

She enjoys gaming, teddy bears, and beating up racist shitheads. Turn offs include nightmares about her dead parents, losing at DDR, and professional behavior on the part of medical professionals.

### Anonymous ###

> Adopt her?
> *- Anonymous 12/16/06(Sat)14:38:47 No.17396289*

Something was different today. For once, the /b/tards who called themselves Anonymous did not display their typical face.

While they ramble in some "colorful" discussions (In the thread right before they were dumping CP), Nurse-kun's story led Anonymous to respond with a mix array of emotive replies, sharing Nurse-kun's desire to heal. Anonymous even drew some nice pictures for Amputee-chan in an effort to make the girl happy, and for once in her life she actually laughed.

### Desu Girl ###

> Oh OP, you were always so romantic.
> *- Desu Girl 12/17/06(Sun)14:05:55 No.17445916*

An recurring character who claims to be Amputan from the year 2026, to hilarious effect. Desu Girl foreshadows Nurse-kun's change in attitude from helpless observer to benevolent father figure. Her posts were not archived on Wikichan and were only recently discovered with the original thread archives.

### Sarafan ###

A sysop of Wikichan who tirelessly archived each thread of Nurse-kun's story. Before the 4chanarchive was created, people like Sarafan were the only ones keeping records of 4chan's greatest stories and achievements.

*Also, one of his secret archives held the original html dumps of exactly what the threads looked like, along with all the fanart. We owe a lot to this /b/tard.*

### Shii ###

Full Article: Shii

> I wrote the suck-ass anonymous message board software that they (4chan) still use today, despite never having taken a programming class ever.
> *- Shii*

A very significant person, engineer, and admin in Something Awful's ADTRW, world2ch, and early 4chan. He claims to have gotten 4chan's 10MGET, (hazukiget), and was a major proponent in the use of anonymous BBS systems. He sometimes posted anonymously to Nurse-kun's threads, and drew one of the fan art.

Due to the incompetence of Wikichan's admins, it's content was habitually lost every year and spammed into oblivion in the middle. Right before Wikichan went down for good, Shii saved this story to his own site. Without this guy, the story of Nurse-kun would have been damned to oblivion.


## Trivia

### Misc.

* Nurse-kun probably gave the girl a [Terry's Chocolate Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry%27s_Chocolate_Orange). These are pretty god damn tasty, but as in the story, they are a rather difficult candy to open, thus why he "broke" it beforehand.
* Nurse-kun also gave the girl a small hand-sized Teddy Bear. This is a damn fine idea for a gift for a ~7 year old.

### Loli haet pizza

![Loli haet pizza](lolihaetpizza.png)

> ...no. I don't like pizza.
> --Ampu-tan

Loli haet pizza is an ancient meme with an uncertain origin. It's likely that the original author intended to say, lol i hate pizza, but she or he forgot to press the space key, resulting in 4chan's most epic typo.

### Elfen Lied
**Nana's Everyday Life**

Elfen Lied is somewhat a harem anime crossed with guro (Grotesque or more known as Gore), which makes it appealing for some. It's mostly about a girl called Nyu/Lucy who's a mysterious and deadly breed of horned humans called diclonius. She comes to live with a guy called Kouta.

Lucy/Nyu are two separate personalities of a single girl. Lucy is a cold blooded insane killer, product of cruel experiments at the mutant research facility. Nyu on the other hand is opposite of Lucy; innocent and incapable of violence. Nyu came about after a .50 BMG round ricocheted off a metallic helmet encasing her head. When Nyu is attacked violently, she regresses to Lucy. Like wise when Lucy is treated with love and kindness, she will uncontrollably switch back to Nyu.

Nana is another diclonius who Lucy dismembered in a violent outburst at the research facility. She lost all her limbs but eventually learned to use prosthetic appendages with her telekinetic powers.

Nana's Everyday Life is a disturbing (and thus considered awesome) web comic by Dan Kim with Nana as the main character. Dan Kim have a sick sense of humour and it shows up in NEL and his other works, which endears them to the typical /b/tard since 4chan pretty much revolves around that kind of humour. Conversely Dan seems to be a bit of a /b/tard himself and /b/ memes often end up in his manga. (a certain bear, one of the mascots of /b/ even appeared in Nana's Everyday Life).

Unlike her counterpart in Elfen Lied, in NEL Nana does not learn how to use prosthetics. Readers of Nurse-kun's story were quick to point out to him some of the parallels between NEL and Damaged Goods. After reading NEL, Nurse-kun personally stated that "fictions will remain that way, if I have anything to say about it."

### Ghost in the Shell
**Motoko Kusanagi**

Nurse-kun has apparently seen this anime, and the origami crane scenes within it. This inspired him to suggest origami activities to Amputee-chan.

Motoko was nine years old when she was severely injured in a plane crash. The other survivor of the crash was a six year old boy named Hideo Kuze. As Kuze lies in his bed, he felt sorry for Motoko lying in her bed next to him in a coma. The reason for his emotion was because he know she will never recover. So with the only functional part of his body left; his left hand, he started folding paper cranes for her. According to Japanese legend if a thousand cranes are made, a wish would be granted.

To save Motoko, a procedure was carried out on her to replace her dying body with a fully cybernetic one. After recovering, Motoko returned to Kuze. Kuze asked her if it was possible to make paper crane with a cybernetic body. Motoko tried but failed as she was unable to adapt to the fine motor skills of her new prosthetic parts. She left Kuze and promised to return when she was able to fold cranes. Soon afterwards Kuze underwent the same cybernetic process.

Later in the series, taking place many years after, both Motoko and Kuze were seen on occasions to fold paper cranes single-handedly as they've grown accustomed to their new bodies.

### Densha Otoko (Train Man)

Some people have pointed out that Nurse-kun's story may well become 4chan's version of Densha Otoko. Densha Otoko was originally an ongoing story on the Japanese forum 2ch. The story goes that an otaku who with the help of other posters of 2ch managed to break out of his shell and propose to a girl after saving her from a drunk on a train. This story has gone stupidly popular in Japan, to the extent of spawning a movie, TV series, manga, novel and whatnot based on it.

While 4chan has had epic threads in it's history, none of them has come anywhere near the celebrity status of Densha Otoko. The ongoing nature of Nurse-kun's story and how anonymous was giving advice to him draw many parallels between the two stories.

Of course, the difference in the nature of the two story could probably attest to the difference in atmosphere between 2ch and 4chan. If Densha Otoko came to ask for advice on /b/ on 4chan, we would have to wonder what kind of advice he would of encountered. (Barrel rolls and S.I.I.H.P. comes to mind)

### Elite Beat Agents/Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan

Elite Beat Agents is a Nintendo DS game which Nurse-kun plays with Amputee-chan. It is an American remake of a Japanese game called Osu! Takakae! Ouendan (roughtly Go! Fight! Cheersquad.)

The main characters of Elite Beat Agents are members of a fictional government agency responsible for helping those in need. When someone facing a crisis reaches the end of their rope and cries out for help, the agents arrive on the scene to help them succeed. Through the dancing of the agents, the people they came to help are instilled with motivation that helps them overcome various obstacles. Ouendan is similar in this aspect but where they differ is that Ouendan are an all male cheering squad (in which Japanese schools actually support) that come to the aid and commence their manly cheering.

The Christmas stage in EBA which Nurse-kun was worried about, is about the agents assisting a young girl in reuniting with the spirit of her deceased father. Since it was around Christmas when Amputee-chan was playing EBA, and her parents died recently in a car crash, one could understand why this stage might be a bit too close to home.

At the planetarian, I mean, planetarium, the song that Nurse-kun and Amputee-chan laugh at and sing together is called "Jumpin' Jack Flash" by The Rolling Stones. It is the song for stage 26 of EBA.

### Waha

Waha is a chibi version of Yamato Suzuran from the visual novel, Suigetsu Mayoi Gokoro. The chibi Waha is a creation of 2channers. Waha is much loved both at 2chan and at 4chan for... actually we don't know why we like her, she's just lovable without a need of any explanation. There's a well known dancing Waha animated GIF that Nurse-kun apparently made into a flip book and gave to Amputee-chan for Valentines.

Nurse-kun does feel some apprehension when giving Amputan a picture of Waha, as she was developed from a character in an H-game. Hopefully, she'll never know.

### Katawa Shoujo

Around the same time that this story was concieved, a bunch of people from 4chan came together to make the first major English-language visual novel doujin: Katawa Shoujo. The cast is entirely made out of girls with disabilities, and became quite popular in the three years before it's first full release in 2012.

The visual novel is [available for free download](http://katawa-shoujo.com/) at their site.

[Leigh Alexander of Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/katawa-shoujo/) hints that 4chan's love of "Damaged Goods" (girls with disabilities) began not as another creepy fetish, but as a wave of empathy that anons felt after reading Nurse-kun's story.

## Fanart and other stuff

<s>(there was a lot of cool pictures that Anonymous drew, but the majority were lost when Wikichan went down. A few were saved by Shii and Encyclopedia Dramatica, but half of that was lost when Encyclopedia Dramatica itself was deleted.)</s>

All pictures have now been discovered in their original resolution from Sarafan's archive. They can be found in the addenum threads in the Chapters page.

## Thread Archives ##

These are direct html files of the original threads as they looked like on 4chan, as posted to Wikichan. All of these would have been lost due to Rapidshare's deletion policy, if not for a previously undiscovered upload that Sarafan made. We used these to add Anonymous's replies to Nurse-kun threads, as the ones on Wikichan and Shii's site only contained the story.

* [Sarafan still remembers](http://www.mediafire.com/?9fu3d4v06vgr26n) This is the original archive that helped us so much. It's a bit messy though, so use the one above.
