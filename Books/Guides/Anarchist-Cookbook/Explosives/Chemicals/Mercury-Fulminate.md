Mercury fulminate is perhaps one of the oldest known initiating
compounds. It can be detonated by either heat or shock, which would make it of
infinite value to an anarchist. Even the action of dropping a crystal of the
fulminate causes it to explode. 

Mercury  fulminate  is  an  initiating  explosive, commonly appearing as
white  or  gray  crystals.  It  is  extremely sensitive to initiation by heat,
friction,  spark  or  flame, and impact. It detonates when initiated by any of
these  means.  It  is pressed into containers, usually at 3000 psi, for use in
detonators  and blasting caps. However, when compressed at greater and greater
pressure  (up to 30,000 psi), it becomes "dead pressed." In this condition, it
can  only  be detonated by another initial detonating agent. Mercury fulminate
gradually  becomes inert when stored continuously above 100 degrees F. A dark-
colored  product  of  deterioration  gives  evidence  of  this effect. Mercury exfulminate  is  stored underwater except when there is danger of freezing. Then
it is stored under a mixture of water and alcohol.

A person making this material would probably
use the following procedure:

     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ                  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
     5 g mercury               glass stirring rod

     35 ml concentrated         100 ml beaker (2)
     nitric acid

     ethyl alcohol (30 ml)      adjustable heat source

     distilled water            blue litmus paper

                                funnel and filter paper

Solvent alcohol must be at least 95% ethyl alcohol if it is used to make
mercury fulminate. Methyl alcohol may prevent mercury fulminate from forming.

Mercury thermometers are becoming a rarity, unfortunately.  They may be
hard to find in most stores as they have been superseded by alcohol and other
less toxic fillings. Mercury is also used in mercury switches, which are
available at electronics stores. Mercury is a hazardous substance, and should
be kept in the thermometer or mercury switch until used. It gives off mercury
vapors which will cause brain damage if inhaled.  For this reason, it is a
good idea not to spill mercury, and to always use it outdoors. Also, do not
get it in an open cut; rubber gloves will help prevent this.

1. In one beaker, mix 5 g of mercury with 35 ml of concentrated nitric acid,
   using the glass rod.
2. Slowly heat the mixture until the mercury is dissolved, which is when the
   solution turns green and boils.
3. Place 30 ml of ethyl alcohol into the second beaker, and slowly and
   carefully add all of the contents of the first beaker to it.  Red and/or
   brown fumes should appear. These fumes are toxic and flammable.
4. After thirty to forty minutes, the fumes should turn white, indicating that
   the reaction is near completion.  After ten more minutes, add 30 ml of the
   distilled water to the solution.
5. Carefully filter out the crystals of mercury fulminate from the liquid
   solution.  Dispose of the solution in a safe place, as it is corrosive and
   toxic.
6. Wash the crystals several times in distilled water to remove as much excess
   acid as possible.  Test the crystals with the litmus paper until they are
   neutral.   This will be when the litmus paper stays blue when it touches
   the wet crystals
7. Allow the crystals to dry, and store them in a safe place, far away from
   any explosive or flammable material.

This procedure can also be done by volume, if the available mercury
cannot be weighed.  Simply use 10 volumes of nitric acid and 10 volumes of
ethanol to every one volume of mercury.

## Recipe 2

Five grams of mercury is added Ext55 
cc.  of nitric acid (specific gravity 1.42) in a 100-cc. Erlenmeyer flask, and
the  mixture  is  allowed  to stand without shaking until the mercury has gone
into  solution. The acid liquid is then poured into 50 cc. of 90% alcohol in a
500-cc.  beaker  in the hood. The temperature of the mixture rises, a vigorous
reaction  commences,  white  fumes  come  off,  and cdata  bstals of fulminate soon
begin  to precipitate. Red fumes appear and the precipitation of the fulminate
becomes  more  rapid,  then white fumes again as the reaction moderates. After
about  20  minutes, the reaction is over; water is added, and the cdata  bstals are
washed  with  water repeatedly by decantation until the washings are no longer
acid   to  litmus.  The  product  consists  of  grayish-yellow  cdata  bstals,  and
corresponds  to a good grade of commercial fulminate. It may be obtained white
and  entirely  pure  by  dissolving  in  strong  ammonia water, filtering, and
reprecipitating  by  the  addition  of  30% acetic acid. The pure fulminate is
filtered  off,  washed  several times with cold water, and stored under water,
or,  if  a very small amount is desired for experimental purposes, it is dried
in a desiccator.
