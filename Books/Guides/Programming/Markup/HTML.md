**HyperText Markup Language** (HTML) makes web pages display properly on the World Wide Web. It is a markup language, which means it has a mix of a normal language that people can read, and a special programming language that tells computers what to do. HTML is sent and received through HTTP.

A web browser is the program that reads the special language in HTML. This language tells the web browser how the web page should look. The web page can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. It can also have writing that is not shown in the web page, which tells people about the web pageâ€”for example, the name of the person who made it.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops HTML. The latest version is XHTML 1.1. It uses XML and can include other XML-languages.

## Example

```html
    <html>

      <head>
        <title>Title of page</title>
      </head>

      <body>
        Body of the page
      </body>

    </html>
```
