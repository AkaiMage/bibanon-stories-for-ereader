At one time, 4chan's /a/ board developed a trend of threads challenging users to do cute things with their sisters and post reports. Common were "tooth-brushing" threads, where the idea was for an anon to offer to brush their imouto's teeth.

One person did so, then told the story over a period of several months, being dubbed Oral Hygiene Bro.

I have a tale for you, /a/.

A few days ago, a thread was posted suggesting /a/ brush his sister's teeth. After some consideration, I offered and eventually did brush my younger sister's teeth for her. I thought it was fun, and she didn't seem to dislike it - though she also didn't think much of my technique. That's the backstory; here's the main event.

Tonight my sister interrupted my browsing 4chan to ask about my day. Very thoughtful on her part, but not unusual. As we talked, she mentioned that she was going to get ready for bed soon. I thought nothing of it. It wasn't until she repeated that she was "going to go brush her teeth" and started slowly slinking out of the room that I picked up on what she wanted. At that point, I asked if she wanted a hand with that - and she quickly accepted. I went with her to brush her teeth again.

Tonight's session was less messy than the previous attempt since we both knew what we were doing; as before, I stood behind her and brushed from the view in the mirror. I found navigating her mouth with the brush significantly less difficult this time. While brushing, I noticed that she seemed unsure of what to do with her hands tonight. She moved them from the sink to almost touching my hands to her hips on more than one occasion.

In the end, she thanked me for brushing her teeth for her. I felt a little awkward, and I'm sure she did too. Once was just for fun, but now it felt... well, it wasn't what I might normally call intimate, but this is a lot closer than we've been since she was six or so. I'm not sorry I did it; she expressed genuine gratitude for my help. She also suggested that my brushing skill had improved. I was happy to receive her praise.

Since this chain of events was initated here, I thought I might post this in hopes that the OP of that thread see that his request did not fall on deaf ears.

I have a new story for you, /a/.

Last I posted, I had brushed my sister's teeth for the second time. Unlike the first time, the second brushing felt more deliberate and awkward. I thought that we wouldn't have a third performance. I was wrong.

While I watched television about an hour ago, she sat down beside me. Her giggles and smile told me she was having a good night. I listened as she spoke blithely about her adventures at school. At length I put my arm around her and squeezed her briefly against me, then returned to the television. Not to be ignored, she told me she wanted to switch tonight. Further inquiry on my part revealed that she wished to brush my teeth. I accepted.

Since she stands a full head shorter than myself, conventional brushing was difficult. I tried sitting down so she could brush from the front, but that didn't work, resulting in toothpaste on my shirt. She eventually procured a small step-stool and stood behind me, brushing my teeth in the mirror - as I had done hers. The feeling was... exquisite. She was incredibly gentle; she asked frequently if she was pushing too hard. After each pause for me to spit, she reengaged with renewed fervor. I was sorry for it to end. When she stepped down, she told me that I was right - that brushing someone else's teeth was fun. She was shining, and so was I.

Thank you, /a/. This was a most worthwhile endeavour you recommended.

I have posted in the past on this topic. My sister and I have developed an occasionally problematic and somewhat needy nightly ritual because of these threads. After brushing her teeth at the behest of /a/, she decided that in addition to my brushing her teeth, she should brush mine. As of this week, we're brushing our own teeth only once a day; the nightly brushing is done by the other. The odd thing about this, though, is that I don't really want to stop it. It's both endearing and affirming that my sister and I are close - something of which I am most glad.

I'm in graduate school. She's in high school. I approached the subject with curiousity and interest - offering to brush her teeth only as a passing fancy - and while she initially declined the offer, after we talked about other subjects for a while she decided she did, in fact, want to give it a try. This has been... hmm, three weeks ago? It was only awkward after the second brushing. Before that was fun, and everything afterwards has been great. It was the second time that really made me think we wouldn't be doing it again.

Hello again, /a/, from he who brushes his sister's teeth. I have an update to my curious tale for you.

A quick recap of events thus far: Roughly a month ago, /a/ suggested we should brush our sister's teeth for them. Intrigued by this concept, I did so. My sister and I so enjoyed the experience that not long afterward, she hinted that she wanted me to offer to brush them again - and I did so. From that point on, I have brushed her teeth every night, and she occasionally brushed mine. This odd arrangement has continued - until last night.

As was the routine, when my sister had finished her shower she requested that I brush her teeth. The thrill of the act has passed, somewhat; now I comply for the closeness that holding her softly and cleaning her teeth provides. Tonight went as previous brushings have, until the end. As I finished, I told her we were done and prepared to head back to Internet minutiae; before I could turn away, she solidly embraced me and asked to reciprocate immediately. Somewhat surprised by her hug, I acquiesced.

She took particular care that night to brush my teeth thoroughly. She would tilt my head this way and that so as to get the best angle in the mirror to view her work. I'd be lying if I said I didn't relish in her doting; her gentle and cautious brushing is truly luxurious. After at least twice again the time a normal brushing would take, she reluctantly ended my session. I thanked her, but she informed me we weren't done yet. Still standing on her footstool, she ordered me to open my mouth.

For what seemed like a long while, she looked at my teeth. I watched her eyes dart around my mouth and occasionally meet my gaze. On the stool, she stood a few inches taller than me; usually the hight difference between us is quite the opposite. Hesitantly, experimentally, she put her index finger in my mouth and pushed lightly on my back teeth. Amused by the serious face she was wearing, I responded by closing my mouth and sucking her finger. She blushed instantly and let out an audible yip, pulling her finger from my mouth. Grinning at her, I waited for her response. She looked in my eyes, looked at my mouth, and edged closer to me.

I am no fool, /a/. I understood your intent when you made that thread a month ago. I didn't care - I understood my family well enough that I was quite sure there would be no drastic changes to our relationship because of any one event. That said, my sister's charmingly rouge cheeks, uneven breath, and parted lips told me at that moment that I may have been mistakened: that she wanted to express our newfound closeness with a different sort of affection. I wouldn't say I froze - rather, I simply didn't move as she leaned forward. I closed my eyes and felt her mouth brush against my upper lip. When no further pressure followed, I opened my eyes and saw her looking guiltily away from me. I hugged her against me and told her thank you again, and then left the room.

This was yesterday evening. She has been cordial but skittish every time I see her tonight, and in about one hour she will have her shower and prepare for bed. I am curious to know if she will ask me to brush her teeth again.

I find myself hoping she does.

Oral Hygiene Brother here, with an update.

Thanks to /a/, I am quite content to brush my sister's teeth for her, and she mine - but after what can best be described as an awkward, aborted, post-brushing kiss attempt on her part earlier, I was concerned that our toothbrushing days were numbered. However, the next night indicated that the status quo had returned again.

This update is not about recent events; our relationship currently seems stable. Rather, I'll describe events that took place on the day following my previous update.

On that night, I brushed her teeth as was usual, and again she asked to brush mine afterward. I felt a thrill at her request: this meant she was not upset about what happened earlier. After she finished, I turned around and lifted her down from the step-stool she had been using. In that moment in which our faces were close, I felt an impulse which I could not ignore. I pecked her lightly on the lips. Her bright blushing and immediate demand to know what I thought I was doing was precious. Could her brother not kiss as a show of appreciation, I reasoned? Surely there was no harm in a brief family kiss, particularly since we both now had minty fresh breath. I admitted to her that the closeness I felt with her over the past month was very valuable to me, and that I was glad to have her as my steadfast and irreplaceable sister. Warily, she admitted she felt the same about our improved rapport, and affirmed that family-style kisses - ie. no-tongue, apparently - would be okay.

Shortly before going to bed, she inquired as to why I originally wanted to brush her teeth. At a loss for words, I gave her the truth: the Internet suggested it. After considering this, she asked whether the Internet offered any other such suggestions. I declined to go into the naughtier specifics, but I gave her a few examples I remembered. She found the hair brushing suggestion particularly interesting; this has resulted in an increase in our nightly grooming time together.

Ah, yes. In short, after I had brushed her teeth, she demanded to brush mine. She spent a great deal of time on that. Afterward, she wanted to look at my teeth, and eventually put a finger in my mouth - on which I gently sucked, causing her some degree of consternation. After that, she leaned in close, and I suspected what she wanted to do. I closed my eyes and waited for soft lips to brush over my upper lip only. She must have significantly embarrassed herself, though, because she stopped. I hugged and thanked her and I wasn't sure what to make of that at the time.

I didn't brush my sister's teeth tonight. She is feeling ill.

Despite the possibility that she has the dreaded swine flu, I have been taking care of her. If I get sick as well, then so be it; it will have been for a good cause. For most of the day I have sat with her and kept her hydrated; I also served as a nurse for any requests she might have had. She has taken medicine for her fever, and I have been monitoring her health: Tiredness, chills, fever, dizziness, and cough. For my part, I find myself distracted by her pain; at the risk of sounding cliche, I would take it upon myself if I could. I don't tell her that, of course. She has enough to cope with as it stands.

In lieu of describing a nightly brushing, I'll instead mention that serving as a nurse for my sister was not at all distasteful. Chauvinistic or not, seeing her in a weakened state reminded me how adorably cute my sister is. Of course, helping her to relax and recover was always paramount in my mind. When she felt cold, I brought her additional blankets and sat with her while she sipped hot tea. We talked of idle things when she had the strength to do so, and I let her rest when she felt tired. She expressed to me how calm she felt when I sat with her, and thanked me for "wasting" time taking care of her. Running my hand along her shoulder and arm as she lay on her side, I confided that I never considered time spent with her a waste.

She's resting now; I would not be on /a/ were it otherwise. I write these updates for /a/ because you inspired me to become closer with my sister; times such as these remind me that we were always close, however.
