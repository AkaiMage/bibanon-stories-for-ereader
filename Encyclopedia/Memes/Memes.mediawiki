Quickly caught on, now used as an "I'm not sure" response if the question posed has possibly many answers. This is the first meme ever originating from /ck/.

; Balki
: Balki Bartokomous, a character from the 80s sitcom "Perfect Strangers" became a meme after a user posted an image macro of him with the text, "Don't be ridikulus!" on [[/b/]]. The quote was his catchphrase from the show, and the Balkiroll has even turned out to be a welcomed alternative to the [[Duckroll]].

; [[Boromir]]
: Popular subject in altered pictures, the most popular meme being variations on "One does not simply walk into Mordor," with popular variations such as "one does not simply drive into Mordor" and "in Soviet Mordor, Boromir simply walks into you", occasionally accompanied by a speech bubble containing "wryyyy"  Pictures often have to do with big gaping vaginas the size of hallways due to the [[wordfilter]] on "Mordor". The proper 'response' picture is an exasperated picture of Aragorn captioned "OK, how the fuck does one get into Mordor then?"

; [[/a/#Kaede Fuyou|Boxcutter]]

; [[Break the support disk]]

; [[Brian Wilson]]
: Debatable meme status; even more than Milhouse, Brian Wilson has become an anti-meme. Pictures were used innumerable times during the 2Mil Get flood of July 27, 2005, to early July 28. Also debatably not as sexy as Mandy Moore.

; Duffy
: The original meme of gif. Which always had gifs of accidents and other misfortunes that happen to people but super impose a floating Patrick Duffy head with glowing eyes that shoot laser beams, and balls of energy which makes it look like Duffy is the cause of the mayhem.

; [[AERIS DIES|DYKE SPIES]]

==E==
; [[/a/#Elevens|Elevens]]

; [[Emo]]

; [[MySpace#Emo MySpace Guy|Emo MySpace Guy]]

; Emotes
: For the low low price of five dollars, a user can activate a word filter that will make a small .gif appear on [[/b/]].  It works by placing your choice of text inside two colons (:cockbean:
:eng101:) and then having that text filtered to the gif of the user's choosing.  Popular examples include Professor Smiley, Ice Burn, and Pwned.  Inspired by/borrowed from the SomethingAwful forums.  The most well known of these was
:zdx4875: which activated Professor Smiley.  It was made public on [[/b/]] in the Winter of 2005, and for about 24 hours before the mods de-activated it, [[/b/]] was filled with the Professor.

; [[Enjoy your AIDS]]

; "Enough is enough, I've had it with these snakes"
: A quote from the Snakes on a Plane trailer, said by the star of the movie, Samuel L. Jackson. Experienced a short boom of popularity when the trailer was first released (in many cases, "Snakes" was replaced to give new meaning to the quote, eg. "Enough is enough, I've had it with these DESUS"), but has since only been quoted on occasion.

; [[E-penis]]

; [[Era-chan]]

; [[/a/#Euphemia Li Britannia|Euphemia Li Britannia]]

; ''Evangelion''
: A well known anime. Generates much drama, particularly on /a/, when mentioned between the fans and haters of the series (both groups being extremely vocal in their opinions). These drama sessions invariably degenerate into a massive hatefest. See also Gendo and Rei-chan.

; [[Excuse me wtf r u doin]]

; [[Theme Days#Every repost is repost repost.|Every repost is repost repost.]]

== F ==

; F40PH
: A locomotive that is considered "Awesome" and has been used to troll Fchan by posting random photos of them. Although it is thought to have started on 7chan, 1chan claims responsibility for this meme. Some 4chaners now state that Friday is now F40PH Friday replacing furry Friday. The F40PH has also been edited into other memes or just shopped in odd and funny ways. 

; Fag
: Generic insult for anyone the poster doesn't like, especially if they're whining or trying to draw attention to themselves; similar in meaning to "asshole." Has little or nothing to do with the target's sexuality. Often used as a suffix to mock groups the poster thinks are troublemakers ([[Fag#Tripfag|tripfags]], furfags, etc.) Though recently, the "-fag" suffix has been used as an demonym of a particular field (for example, an artist will call himself a "drawfag" or a writer will call himself a "writefag").

; Fail
: Used as a noun in the place of "failure".

; FAILGET
: The standard response to a failed #GET attempt (such as posting 1000000GET on post number 9999999 of [[/b/]], or 2GET as the 3rd post of a thread). Also sometimes used to to claim that a GET sucked, as some felt to be the case with most of [[/b/]]'s GETs from 5MGET onward.

; Fap
: Noise made during male masturbation. '''Fap fap fap fap''' Originated in a translation of the manga "Heartbreak Angels"; it was then popularized in the web comic Sexy Losers by clay (contrary to popular belief, it did not originate there), and has since spread to the entire Internet.

; [[Fatty-tan]]

; [[Imageboard|Fchan]]

; [[fgsfds]]

; Fixed
: A reply that includes a quote of the original post that's been "corrected" in a way that partially or completely changes its meaning, followed by "Fixed." on the next line. For example, a post saying "FF7 is the best game ever" might be replaced with:

:: >"FF7 is the most overrated game ever"
:: Fixed.

: Sometimes the Fixed is taken to an extreme level where the fixed statement has absolutely no similarity to the original statement. For example, a post saying "FF7 is the best game ever" might be replaced with:

:: >"I love to suck meaty cocks in the morning"
:: Fixed.

; FLIP-UP LIGHTS MAKE YOUR CAR GO FASTER
: A meme started in /o/ that is frequently used to tell off people obsessed with the Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-Apex (AE86, the car driven by the main character Takumi Fujiwara in the popular anime Initial D) who think it is the greatest car in the world. Sometimes changed to tell off ricers who post pictures of their car in /o/ in the forms of "LEDS MAKE YOUR CAR GO FASTER", etc.

; Force Push
: An animated gif that begins with a scene from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, where Obi-Wan Kenobi is fighting battledroids, then turns and performs a force push towards the screen. The picture then cuts to another scene where a person or object suddenly falls or is sent flying. A newer meme usually found on /gif/.

; [[Anonymous Posting#Forced Anonymous|Forced Anonymous]]

; [[:Category:Forced and Failed Memes|Forced meme]]

; [[Four Chan Magazine]]

; Francesca Dani
: Another drama-inducing cosplayer that's usually hated on /cgl/. She's highly criticized for buying costumes off of eBay and claims that she did them all by herself. Threads about her are suspiciously deleted before they are due.

; Freehaven
: The former moderator/administrator of furry imageboard Fchan, and one of /b/'s greatest foes due to his lack of caring about how much fun /b/ makes of him and his furry fetish. Is considered a major troll. Full name is Sage Freehaven.

; Fronzel
: A [[Fag#Tripfag|tripfag]] on /a/ well-known for his harsh criticism of countless anime and general hard-to-please attitude. Loved by some, hated by others. Also a self-admitted lolicon - he can be found on /l/ on occasion. Went missing around the beginning of 2006 for unknown reasons and reappeared two months later.

; Fuck Socks
: A picture from an H-game had a guy sticking his dick in a girl's thigh-high stocking while fingering her. Saying "I want to fuck her socks" is related to "I'd hit it".  Not seen too often.

; [[FUCK THAT! You're going home!]]

; Fucktard
: Short for "fucking retard".

[[Image:35634564566345.jpg|thumb]]
; '''Fugly'''
: A forced meme, also known as Lazyeye to some, which started appearing on /b/, and 7chan. He is mostly noticed for his lasy eye, or his apperence. 
<br clear="all" />

; FUKKEN SAVED
: Used when a particularly awesome/funny/hot image is posted on [[/b/]]. Originates from the popular [[/b/]] MSPaint comics. The one in question refers to the "20 minutes" facade on [[/b/]], as well as WT Snack's relinquishing of his mod powers. WT Snacks is browsing [[/b/]], and is at first shocked to see CP on the board. He then looks joyful as he saves the image and shouts in joy "FUKKEN SAVED". Now FUKKEN SAVED is used when ever Child Porn is posted.

; Gender Verification
: The Gender Verification meme was started the week of August 14th, 2006. The most common use of this meme is "WE DEMAND GENDER VERIFICATION," but the creators have modified it to "WE DEMAND A BARREL ROLL AND GENDER VERIFICATION." It has also been seen as "PROOF OF GENDER REQUIRED." It is meant as a replacement/supplement to the [[TITS OR GTFO]] meme. It is normally used regarding Stickam raids, but can be used anytime a picture of a girl is posted. It first began appearing from other members on [[/b/]] the week of August 20th, 2006, and is slowly gaining popularity.

; Gendo Ikari
: Gendo is the father of Shinji in the popular anime series ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'', which receives both praise and criticism on [[/b/]]. As the head of NERV he is normally found with a uncaring expression on his face, amplified with his reflective glasses and steepled hands over his mouth (a pose originally created so that the animators wouldn't have to waste time and money drawing his mouth moving when he talked but that became his signature pose). During the first forced-anon period someone posted Gendo arms and glasses (as well as eyebrows) on a manga scan. Shortly following a set of arms and glasses precut for shopping was posted. After that a rush of 300+ Gendo shops appeared on [[/b/]]. Recently on [[/b/]], Gendo has had the nickname 'Evil Ambassador' placed unto him, as this spawned from an [[Anonymous]] poster asking for the arm and glasses from the Gendo meme, but not knowing what the meme was called and so he named it "Evil Ambassador", which [[/b/]] found amusing and started to know Gendo as Evil Ambassador.

; ggmister
: "Leader" of the [[Pool's Closed|Habbo invasions]] during the months of February, March and June 2006. Last seen training nigras and coordinating experienced pool /b/lockers for the planned 9/11 raid, however after the hacking of poolsclosed.com his whereabouts are unknown. Known for his temporary lack of an afro, as the mods shaved it during 7/12/06 ([[Never Forget]]).

; Ghosts
: [[/b/]]tards hold some interest in paranormal phenomena. So-called "ghost pictures", which claim to point out spirits in photographs, are not taken too seriously, though. Images with red arrows pointing where the supposed "ghost" is are often ridiculed.

; [[/v/#Giant Enemy Crab|Giant Enemy Crab]]

; [[GMask]]

; GNAA
: Gay Nigger Association of America. An infamous Internet troll group that has targeted 4chan on occasion. They seem to be connected with [[Imageboard|WTFux]].org on many levels. Famously "got" All8GET, and once almost shut down 4chan through furious and unrepentant spamming. Despite this history, some [[/b/]]tards consider them allies for [[Invasions|raids]].

; [[/co/#Goddamn Batman|Goddamn Batman, The]]

; [[Good Naruto, you look kind of cool]]

[[Image:Glface.jpg|thumb]]
; Green Lantern
: Strange and humorous drawn image of Green Lantern's face -- Hal Jordan, specifically. Often posted at random, or used to express shock or surprise at other posts; due to the expression of the character's face. Was posted in great numbers in early 2006; a notable example being the "Night of 100 Lanterns," in which the same image of Green Lantern was posted one-hundred or more times in a single thread, and then spammed copiously across the entirety of /b/. Source of original image is the cover of Green Lantern #35 (March 1965), it was first posted in /b/ in early 2006.
<br clear="all" />

; Grieving Jew
: A picture of a Jew grieving. Forced meme in October 2006, generally by spamming one long thread with hundreds of copies of the image.

; [[/a/#Grinbitch|Grinbitch]]

; [[Cockmongler#GRINMAN LIKES TO GRIN|GRINMAN LIKES TO GRIN]]

; GTA<nowiki>[4chan]</nowiki>
: A group of 4channers that played Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas online together with the tag <nowiki>[4chan]</nowiki> in front of their names. While this wasn't a clan it was more like a smaller community where 4channers gathered and played and had fun together. The community died after their allies <nowiki>[PHW]</nowiki> betrayed them and banned them from their shared server causing GTA<nowiki>[4chan]</nowiki>'s leader Rho to disappear shortly thereafter. If you ever ran into another 4channer in the online gaming world you had to spell out the phrase "JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!" followed by both 4channers running towards the nearest car to drive off.

== H ==

; [[HABEEB IT]]

; HAET
: Oft used intentional misspelling of "hate".  A [[/b/]]tard will never spell "hate" properly, instead preferring this intentional misspelling.  Often seen in the phrase (Blank) HAET (Blank), mostly seen as, but not restricted to, "LOLI HAET PIZZA", but seen in variants all over the board. Also see as LOEV.

; [[HA HA HA! Oh, wow]]

; [[/co/#Hal Jordan|Hal Jordan]]

; [[Happy Negro]]

; Harbl
: A codeword used when /z/ was attempting to overthrow [[/b/]]; Is often used as a synonym of 'penis'. See also Soviet Russia, /z/.

; Hawaiian Punch
: On the [[Something Awful]] forums, there was a thread called "Make Porn Worksafe", and it consisted of people photoshopping, you guessed it, porn so as to make it "safe for work." Penetrations were covered, the nude were clothed, and penises were replaced with numerous things, the most popular being cans of Hawaiian Punch.

; [[/co/#HEY LOOK IT'S MAGNETO|HAY LOOK IT'S MAGNETO]]

; HAY GUYS WHAT'S GOIN ON IN THIS THREAD?
: A common post that appears randomly in threads most of the time, but it's used humorously in threads which contain a flood of images, a serious debate, or any thread which generates an obvious amount of attention.

; [[HE POSTED CP GET HIM]]

; HEAD ON - APPLY DIRECTLY TO FOREHEAD
: The slogan of an anti-headache medicine called Head On, which, unsurprisingly, is applied to the forehead to take effect. Spammed furiously on [[/b/]] on 17th July 2006, probably by one or two people. A good example of an unsuccessful forced meme.

; [[Headsigh|Headsigh]]

; Healthy Girl
: Any athletic or muscular girl, live-action or drawn. More generally, any girl who is well-built and does not appear either waifish or anorexic nor morbidly obese. Like most kinks, it is loved and hated in equal amounts on /e/, /h/, /s/, and /d/. The most well-known healthy girl (and the one largely responsible for the meme) is Tamaki Kousaka aka Tama-nee from ''To Heart 2'', whose name can also be read in Japanese as "healthy girl" (ironically, during the course of the game she gets sick and the player character has to take care of her).

; Hitler
: [[/b/]] seems to have a very special relationship with Hitler. Most [[/b/]]tards tend to see Hitler either as "jolly, warm-hearted German fuhrer", "Emo-Hitler" or "crusher of all Jew scum". The relation to Hitler becomes even more of a parody if you see [[/b/]]s huge love for "communism hacks" (red board style, Russian music).

; [[Hive Mind]]

; [[/v/#HOLY SHIT GUYS!|HOLY SHIT GUYS!]]

; Hoodpins
: meme that started in /o/. A frequent user, GSX, had his mother purchase hoodpins for his car (Mitsubishi Ecplise GSX). Versions of this are "hoodpinz, hoodpinz, lol" or "hoodpins give you 50 horsepower each". Once /o/'s favorite meme, it is rarely reposted anymore.

; hope u got 10bux
: From the [[Something Awful]] forums, refers to the cost of re-registering a banned account. Used to mean "you're about to get banned", usually ironically.

; [[Hopkin Green Frog]]

; Horror-chan
: A collection of close-ups of the skin of an unknown sickly person, characterized by wan skin covered with an abundance of gaping sores.

[[Image:Greg_House.jpg|thumb|left|Doctor House will devour your soul.]]
; House
: A relatively new medical drama on FOX. The show stars Greg House, a board-certified diagnostician with a double speciality in infectious disease and nephrology. The show is most known for being 92% awesome and the picture of Dr. House giving a creepy stare. Also, it isn't lupus. [http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/17185747/House/] [http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/24973646/house+wierdness/] [http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/26345111/house+vs.+cox/]

[[Image:How do i ge.jpg|thumb|how do I ge]]
; how do I ge
: Random nonsense posted in any thread as spam similar to DESU. First appeared on 2006, June 28. Origin is a post made in [[/b/]] with the final question, "how do I ge", cut short. Spammed for over an hour in every thread by many [[Anonymous]] until the rest of [[/b/]] started asking if it was now a meme, because 4chan is made up of 12 year old morons. Though it is now rare is can still be found, used for trolling, along with the occasional image macros and mixed meme posts.

; [[¯\(º_o)/¯|How do I shot web?]]

; How does a polar bear know what apples is?
: Fairly successful forced meme on /b/ posted in early 2007 accompanied by the tagline "I'm going to post this picture every day until you like it." Consisted of a picture of a polar bear gnawing at a block of ice that had several apples frozen in it (a so-called 'enrichment' toy to give an animal something to do for a while). One of the first replies was "How does a polar bear know what apples is?" since polar bears are Arctic creatures whose main diet consists of fish and not fruit. Later expanded to include a picture of the polar bear staring down a dog, shopped to include the words "DOG HELP ME GET APPLES". Also seen as "How does polar bear know what thermodynamics is?"

; [[moot|How can you bitch about something you can't see?]]
: We found a way.

== I ==

; [[Nigra#i am a nigra|i am a nigra]]

; I came
: See "Fap" and "I'd hit it". In Japanese "&#12461;&#12479;" (although technically the correct translation would be "??"), usually accompanied by a Shift_JIS character.

[[Image:Id_Hit_It.jpg|thumb|]]
; I'd hit it.
: Describes something as "fuckable". Occasionally substituted with "I'd tap it". Incorrectly used in a famous McDonald's advertising campaign in the US.
<br clear="all" />

; I'M THE NEW COMMISSAR
: Local meme started on /tg/. Someone posted a series of short narratives involving a Warhammer 40,000 Chaos Space Marine by the charming name of Kharn the Betrayer, with each story involving Kharn doing something more and more awesome, and generally involving him killing his own troops in the process. These included stabbing a nuclear warhead into a fellow Space Marine's rotting stomach and throwing him at an enemy city, and planting a meltabomb on a hijacked dropship, and informing the unfortunate guys flying the dropship via a haiku made from the corpses of those he killed hours earlier. The final story involved Kharn walking up to an Imperial Guard Commissar, tearing him in half, and then putting on his nifty little Commissar cap, before bellowing "I'M THE NEW COMMISSAR!" From that point on, nearly every 40k character on /tg/ has had a Commissar cap shopped onto them, with that line being repeated.

; I DEMAND A SMALLER HAT
: An unpopular meme featuring the image of a NYC fireman with a seemingly oversized hat, accompanied by the caption "I DEMAND A SMALLER HAT," first posted in late December 2005. At first this attempt at a forced meme was ridiculed, but soon additional images of people with big hats were being posted. Variations of the caption included "MY HAT IS TOO SMALL" and "I DEMAND A SHORTER HAT," the latter accompanying a picture of Napoleon Bonaparte. The ephemeral craze was over in less than a day's time, but the original image is still occasionally posted.

; [[Imageboard|iiChan]]

; I like where this thread is going.
: Usually a sarcastic comment directed at threads that are about to degenerate into flamewars, or which already have. A related image macro shows a cargo ship sailing toward a massive storm. Occasionally used in a positive sense, particularly when hot porn is posted or camwhores have shared their TITS rather than GTFOing.

[[Image:Ilold.jpg|thumb]]
; I LOL'd
: Minor meme based on the common Internet acronym LOL (laugh out loud). Related to an image macro of He-Man villain Skeletor, with his head thrown back in laughter. Spread to the O RLY owl and Agent Smith among others. Some thought it hit a new low with a shop of coffins from Iraq with "I LOL'D" copiped on it.

; I WISH TO CONVERSE WITH YOUR LEADER
: After a 4channer got banned from a GTA:San Andreas online server for the use of the tag [4chan] in front of his nick with the (ignorant and wrongly accused) reason "All 4channers are cheaters and you've stolen your clan name from a Ventrilo clan! I wish to converse with your leader". The rest of 4chans GTA community thought this was funny and a smaller meme was born. When the server admin refused to lift the ban and said that should he ever see any 4channers on his server again, he wouldn't hesitate to ban them too, along with several insults towards 4chan. When the news hit [[/b/]] an invasion was imminent on the GTA:SA server and its forum. This caused them both to be closed down for a small time.

; I'm a ______, btw
: /tv/ Meme. _____ can be anything from Boy or Girl to Charlee Sheen. Also can be "I'm from ____, btw". Variations may include "And" in front of it.

; I'm in ur base killin ur d00ds
: Originated on battle.net. In the Games forum, someone posted a thread about a Starcraft game in which he had totally owned some poor b.net sod. There was a screenshot of the tard saying "where are you?" and the b.net guy replying "im in ur base, killin ur doodz". The gist of the thread is that the guy who said it ended up losing or something, so it was poetic justice, or whatnot.

: Minor (anti)meme on /dis/ started by the same fuck who flooded [[/b/]] with Kurt Cobain images. Usually replied to with "I really do hope you're retarded and not fucking a troll." Used in /dis/ posts when a poster thinks the thread-starter is an unintentional troll.

; Jack Sparrow
: One day, someone posted a picture in /b/ of a cartoon Jack Sparrow saying, "ALL RIGHT, FUCK THIS SHIT MATEYS, I'M OUTTA HERE". The next two posts beneath it showed the picture of Jack Sparrow sliding out of the image box, leaving a blank white image. Three more posts followed with the blank white box. Then a picture of Jack Sparrow facing the other way was posted next with, "WHOOPS, FORGOT MY HAT". This was widely accepted as one of the funniest posts on 4chan in a long time, and "WHOOPS, FORGOT MY HAT" has been repeated numerous times, though some /b/tards see these repeats as derivative and worn-out. Jack has been seen dueling with Barbossa, running from the Kraken, and marrying a Mudkip. During this time now, it is considered to be a forced meme

; Janitors
: In December 2005, moot decided to add "janitors" to [[/a/]], [[/k/]] and [[/v/]] to help stem the flow of crappy posts without having to bring in more mods. Janitors can delete posts for violating the rules, but unlike mods they can't ban people. Due to the obvious impossibility of nominating [[Anonymous]], only Tripcode users could be nominated to be janitors. Obviously, not found on [[/b/]]. Janitors have since been expanded to most if not all boards, and are no longer nominated by 4chan users (meaning that Anonymous now is eligible).

; JAPAN IS SUPERIOR
: Common catch-phrase in discussions of anime in which a Japanese character is for no logical reason stronger, faster, or smarter than other, non-Japanese characters, or in which Japan or a fictional nation clearly derived from it is inexplicably the dominant power in the world. Basically, every anime ever made.

; Jelly Rolls
: Common response to a thread featuring Yomi from the anime Azumanga Daioh. Yomi, slightly pudgy, is highly self conscious about her weight and is teased by her friend Tomo for being fat despite her having a normal enough body shape; the full version of the meme is "JELLY ROLLS (line break) JELLY ROLLS (line break) NOBODY LOVES YOU". Since Yomi is a fan favorite, especially in /e/, this is occasionally adapted by her fans from "NOBODY LOVES YOU" to "EVERYBODY LOVES YOU". See also: Azumanga Daioh.

; [[Drama#Jeremy Bernal|Jeremy Bernal]]

; Jesus
: [[/b/]] appears to have an obsession of taking images of Jesus and Photoshopping speech bubbles onto them. It is only funny when Jesus ends his sentence with "lol". An example of one such image is a picture of Jesus knocking on a door and the guy behind the door going "who is it?" and Jesus going "It's Jesus, lol". There is also an image of Jesus decked out in bling. See also [[Raptor Jesus]].

; Katamari-chan
: An overweight Asian-Canadian girl who looks very much like a fat Emo boy. The pictures of her usually seen are one of her eating a piece of pocky, or just random face shots. Her posts usually begin with "Dear /b/." And she tells about her sex life, she also asks others to poke fun at her by saying "Feel free to stab me with a harpoon." None of the posts are usually made by the girl in the picture, just an imposter pretending to be her; Confirmed to be her two-faced girlfriend or someone acting like HER as well. More than likely a short-lived meme/failed meme attempt.

; The King
: meme involving Burger King's mascot. Usually posted with "Where is your God now?" or "YOU GONNA GET RAPED", since the King looks like he's insane and may well try to have it HIS way.

; ksqueeks
: A female 4channer who originally gained notoriety posting pictures of herself in /s/ with "donate 2 4chan" written across her chest in an aid to "DONATE OR DIE WEEK 2005". As with other females doing the same, her thread got stickied and she since became a much loved/hated figure among the citizens of /s/ as she continues to provide them with new pictures. On the 15th, the sticky was deleted and a ban on all camwhores in /s/, included ksqueeks, was issued. Although later rescinded, this led to the establishment of ksqueeks' old website making her the only 4chan camwhore with a real website. Lives with her cats Marvin, Beecher, David and Gary in her flat full of anime/video game stuff.

; KOREA EAT CAT
: Old meme originally involving the eating of felines by our Korean friends. Later, overused and worn out, it transformed into any three word phrase with "eat" in it, such as "BANDWIDTH EAT 4CHAN". It is worth noting that Koreans actually do eat dog regularly, cat is not as popular (although it tastes similar to pork). Also the name of a band on [http://www.soundclick.com/koreaeatcat soundclick.com].

; Lamprey mouth
: Lampreys are parasitic fish which, when viewed close-up, show a sucker-shaped mouth filled with dozens of razor-sharp teeth. Lamprey mouths were Photoshopped onto fingers, and were displayed together with Lotus Boobs (below) as part of a double-pack of images intended to make the viewer squirm. Still one of the creepiest images ever posted on /b/.

; LAUNCH THE DAVINCI VIRUS
: One of the epic meme's initiated around the time the movie hackers was released. Whenever any thread involving police or the FBI was posted, it was suggested that the poster launch the davinci virus to thwart the authorities. Usually posted with the vitruvian man [http://www.carbuyersnotebook.com/archives/Da-Vinci-Man.jpg]

; [http://www.lawforkids.org/toons/browse.cfm LawForKids]/[http://www.lawlforkids.com/ LawlForKids]
: A website for the state of Arizona which has a comic section which include one-liners such as "Tommy, you're permanently expelled!" and "Even the passenger gets in trouble". There are frequent threads on /b/ for edits of these comics which interfere with the natural order and makes the comics even funnier.

; Legendary
: Shitty, as a result of a now-inactive [[wordfilter]] in [[/b/]] that replaced "legendary" with "shitty". As a result, threads filled with faggotry and fail tend to be called a "legendary thread". The only one with the power to officially declare a thread legendary is moot, which he did once when someone posted a story about how they spoiled a Harry Potter book to two teenagers and they burst into tears. Everything else is merely "epic".

; Let's Order Linguini
: A small meme originating from an Australian episode of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" where one of the first questions was to define the commonly used internet acronym "LOL".  Let's Order Linguini was the most ridiculous and therefore memorable of the false options. Furthermore, it should be noted that the contestant in question had to use his 'ask the audience' lifeline to answer the question - and while over 60% of the audience steered him true, there was in fact a portion that thought Linguini was the way to go. Silly Australians.

; Lion (AKA RAWR I'M A LION!)
: A white circle with a right side up >:3 in it and a speech bubble with the caption "RAWR I'M A LION!." Lion showed up in early 2006 with the lion image and it went with the saying "JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!" and the very first thread was very popular among [[/b/]] with many shops of the lion face on 4chan memes, lion pictures, and other stuff. Lion was posted many more times in the following months and eventually lion and JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR! became a part of [[/b/]] and you'll never look at a lion or >:3 the same way ever again. 

: The meme has had slight crossover to [[/a/]] referencing Fate Stay Night and pictures of Saber with lions.

; lolicatgirls.swf
: /f/ meme. The file does not actually contain loli cat girls at all, but nonetheless is posted under the [H] tag. The music used in the file is "I Wish (Skazi Remix)" by Infected Mushroom/Skazi.

; LOLI HAET PIZZA
: Is usually said to be based on a typo of "LOL I hate pizza", though it probably spawned from an earlier image macro that said "Loli hate (or possibly haet) PENIS";. Was immediately shopped into an image macro and has persisted as a meme.  Variations now abound, including LOEV (love) replacing HAET when necessary. Also spawned "LOLI LOEV PEDO", which seems to be more prevalent.

; lol internet
: The [[4chan GET Encyclopedia#First GETs|100,000th post]] of [[/b/]]. Completely off topic and in some useless thread, it foiled the plans of bt to gain the 100,000th post. He attempted with an image of "100,000" but received post number 99,999. After calling himself a failure at the internet, he said he was going to [[An Hero#Become An Hero|commit suicide]]. "LOL Internet" (capitalization optional) however, has become a popular meme.[http://img234.imageshack.us/my.php?image=1000005hl.jpg]

; Marcus the Hedgehog
: A 20 year old [[Drama|Babyfur]] whose badly drawn, morally-uplifting comic strips caused quite a stir on /b/.  Each comic centers around his alter-ego, Marcus the Hedgehog, who appears to be a green-and-brown Sonic the Hedgehog dressed in Ash Ketchum's clothing.  /b/ ran a legendary raid on his Deviantart on October 15, 2006, utterly destroying him and causing him to temporarily leave the internet.  The raid consisted of 82 original works of art depicting Marcus in various violent and sexual situations.  These were created in MSPaint, and uploaded to a new Deviantart account under the name "Marcusbarcus."  This page got over 18,000 hits in it's single day of existence, and was eventually banned.  Marcus is a relatively new meme, but is already quite well known in /b/ and /v/, where the comics were originally posted.

; Matthew Graves
: An insane revolutionary cloned many times beyond reason. He was born out of a possible [[trolling]] of a post from [[/f/]] featuring a picture of Tifa with huge stars over her tits. What started as an idiotic request for the [[uncensoring]] of the [[flash]] grew into an overnight revolution, with many [[Anonymous]] converting to the Matthew Graves cult. During late hours he and his clones would rant about the evils of censorship, the virtues of Tifa, or the status of his rocket ship that he is building with his brother (Frances Graves). This caused widespread anarchy across [[/b/]], forcing the censor technicians to ban him and his followers.

; Meatspin.com
: All aspiring members of 4chan, especially [[/b/]], are required to sit through at least 35 seconds of meatspin.com. Or, if said aspirant prefers something else, he can either Google image search for "goatse" or go to lemonparty.org.

; Medieval Macros
: Olde English image macros of existing memes created using the [http://www.adgame-wonderland.de/type/bayeux.php Historical Tale Construction Kit]. New medieval macros show up from time to time as new memes and in-jokes appear, though nothing has yet matched the original flood when [[/b/]] first discovered them.

; MEGATRON
: From the ''Transformers'' movie. Did for Optimus Prime what "KHAAAAAANNNN!!!" did for James T. Kirk, internet-notoriety-wise. A [[Flash]] loop featuring the "YOU MAKE KITTY SCARED" cat screaming "MMMEEEEGGGAAATRRROOONNNNNUUUHHH" became quite popular on [[/f/]], resulting in a further parody where the line is edited into the opening sequence for the TV show ''Law and Order''. A minor /f/ meme.

; [[Meme]]

; meme Money
: A "real life" meme in which members of 4chan's [[/b/]] write common memes or "sup [[/b/]]" on their local currency before putting it back into circulation.  Most members of 4chan agree that it does not matter what country the meme money is from. Recent controversy arose due to some members writing the actual url for [[/b/]]. Some members of [[/b/]] feel that this contribution to meme money will attract unwanted members and/or get 4chan unwanted attention by some goverments.

; Milhouse
: A failed attempt at creating a new meme involving Milhouse of the Simpsons. Included a photoshop of the 'I laugh at your dick' Sakura as Milhouse.

; Milhouse is not a meme.
: True, Milhouse is not a meme. But "Milhouse is not a meme" IS a meme. If you fully understand this you have reached [[/b/]] enlightenment.

; Mirror Image
: "Mirror image" pictures created by taking half of an image and mirroring it to the other side (even using [[MS Paint]], it only takes a few seconds). Usually done with faces, producing results that are symmetrical but often quite freakish. The meme was naturally taken further by including mirrorring multiple times in the same image, which usually fucks it up so severely that it's impossible to recognize the source image. Also known as UNITTINU

; Misa Campo
: New meme in [[/s/]], which arose from an annoying repost seemingly by the same troll looking for a source. Most requests for a source now are typically attributed to her.

; Monar
:A catlike Shift''JIS'' art creature invented on [[2ch]]. Name is derived from his standard comment, "Omae monaa" (You too!). Has many other Shift''JIS'' friends such as "Shii" and "Giko Cat". Monar and his catchphrase are used on 2ch in much the same way that "[[NO U]]" is used on 4chan.

; -MonyToen
: A meme in which "MonyToen" is claiming to have graduated from high school and posting pictures of himself in his ceremony; as well as posting "YAAAYY I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL" and "FCUK YOU". The Picture includes a long haired white teen in a green gown in full stride carrying a diploma as if he was balancing with it. Many MSPaint reproductions of the MonyToen were created which played off of the "I has a shovel" meme and the "I forgot my hat" meme.

; Monsquaz
: Flash animation often reposted in /f/ of a bald naked man rendered in Poser, rising to a backgrond of green arrows, dancing at a sunset, lowering with some pink arrows, and then moving his creepy face towards the camera. Monsquaz has appeared in a variety of other flashes and images. While he is primarily a /f/ meme, he is occasionally reposted in /b/.

; Motivational Posters
: Posters that contain an image, a title and "inspirational" text underneath. One of the most common memes on 4chan due to its almost infinite range of applications, however the minimal effort required to create an image of this sort means that comparatively few are of any notable quality. Most utilize established memes in the same manner as the "Medieval Macros", except with less creativity since a good Medieval Macro requires reworking the meme in Olde English style.

; MOXIE
: A popular soft drink, back in the day. Some time ago, a /b/tard found an old Moxie ad and used it to crapflood, whereupon another began shopping the picture for various purposes. Moxie appears perennially on /b/. Moxie is not a meme.

; MR CAPSLOCK
: An /ic/ meme centering around an anonyfag that types in capslock and gives out the harshest criticism (usually ends up into personal insults). Was given the nickname MR CAPSLOCK. Citizens of /ic/ are somewhat doubtful if MR CAPSLOCK is even the same person in each of his posts.

; MUDA MUDA MUDA
: Dio Brando's other battle cry from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, japanese word which translates to "USELESS". Usually posted in response to jojo related threads or to pictures depicting multiple punchings.

; Muddy dicks
: Derived from a post on a Naruto forum after a few [[/b/]]tards decided to join up. Some members opted to ignore the havoc caused, whereupon another user cried "BUT THERE POSTING MUDDY DICKS". It wasn't mud.

; MUST PUT PENIS IN FATE-CHAN
: Frequently accompanies posting of the character Fate Testarossa, one of the stars of the magical girl anime ''Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha'' and its sequel, ''Nanoha A's''. Ironically, the fact that Fate is less than ambiguously lesbian for Nanoha herself both endears her to her fanboys and simultaneously makes the goal of putting one's penis in her impossible. The fact that she isn't real is also an obstacle. Often spun off into MUST PUT '''INTO'''.

; Must we post EVERY page of EVERY webcomic?
: Minor forced meme when webcomics are posted. Webcomics are despised, notably Megatokyo, and inevitably collaspe into flame wars, especially those featuring an anime art style. Often countered by flames accusing posters of being selfhating Japanophiles. (See JAPAN IS SUPERIOR)

; [[/co/#MY PARENTS ARE DEEEAAAD!!|MY PARENTS ARE DEEEAAAD!!]]

; MySQL Connection Failure
: An annoying event involving some of 4chan's software that occassionally prevents replying to posts. In an earlier incarnation of 4chan, MySQL connection failures also prevented the viewing of threads. At one point, it was so prevalent that one of 4chan's title banners references the phenomenon. The MySQL Connection Error banner is still in the rotation, though the problem is neither as common nor as long-lasting as it used to be. On 9/3/05, the problem came back with a vengeance but has since subsided. Current failures usually involve missing HTML tags, though this has diminished significantly since the server upgrade was completed. Struck again right before 6 MIL Get, annoying everyone.

: A quote from the TV series Sealab 2021 by Captain Murphy was started by [[Fag#Namefag|namefag]] Black_Knight in /b/, as a counter to [[DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]] refering to the post and using the phrase "Nice try doppleganger. Save it for queen Dopplepopolis" This backfired as other users used the phrase as well and it spread to other users and several photoshops of an image being mirrored to face itself with marco next.

; No nips or vag00 = worksafe.
: The debatable claim that any picture that doesn't show nipples or vagina is worksafe. It is often used to justify posting mild /e/ material or "cheesecake" photos (in which the woman is at least partially nude but has her breasts and pussy covered by non-clothing items) on worksafe boards. While technically a penis would fall under the "no nips or vag00" category, it is normally used only in reference to pictures of females.

; No other manga, and maybe no other book, on the bookshelf will leave you thinking like Fullmetal Alchemist
: A sentence taken from Anime News Network's review of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga. (The incorrect comma use is actually part of the review.) A fairly common remark on /a/ when discussing the series itself or general ANN faggotry. Another common variation is "No other anime, and maybe no other television show, on the boob tube will leave you (thinking, fapping, wanting to kill yourself, ect) like (insert anime here.)"

Soon enough, >>15829229 turned out to be a post simply saying "not enough nerve endings," in response to a girl (?) who said "I'd trade my vagina for a PENIS anyday" in a thread about gender swapping. /b/ was ambivalent about whether this constituted a satisfactory GET.

: From the movie trailer cliche of cutting away just before someone finishes saying "Oh shit", usually to a scene of something blowing up. Always used sarcastically. Often seen with the phrases "I BROKE 4chan" with an accompanying screenshot of MySQL failure, "I LEFT 4chan ON AT HOME" in an image macro of a young boy with a scared expression, or "I DIVIDED BY ZERO" in an image featuring a 3D rendering of a black hole.

; Onpu is a whore
: Seen on /a/ and /c/ in threads featuring the character Onpu Segawa, from the anime ''Ojamajo Doremi''. Despite the show's utterly innocent magical-girl nature, the insinuation is that Onpu is a whore because she is a child model and pop singer despite still being in elementary school, as well as her flirtatious nature around the boys in the series and the fact that in a series filled with big-googly-eyed girls, Onpu's are the biggest and googliest of them all. Rarely used in not4chan's /l/ despite frequent posting of her there, perhaps because some /l/ denizens consider a ten year old girl being a whore to be a virtue.

; Optimized .gif Dude
: Originally just a crudely drawn [[MS Paint]] stick figure in [[GIF]] format, it became a fairly popular meme to edit the "Dude" to resemble other memes such as [[Happy Negro]], WRYYYYYY and basically every other meme on 4chan. Nobody knows how many .gif Dudes exist out there.

; ORA ORA ORA
: Uttured by Jotaro Kujo's Stand Star Platinum from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure as it does battle. Unlike the similar MUDA MUDA MUDA, ORA does not translate, as it is not a word. Usually posted in response to jojo related threads or to pictures depicting multiple punchings.

;Pizza Butt
:Nickname for the ''Code Geass'' character C.C., a girl frequently seen eating Pizza Hut pizza and wearing a skin-tight Spandex costume that nearly shows the crack of her ass. The joke is that constantly eating pizza supposedly gives her a big butt. See also: Pizza Hut anime.

;Poland
:On 11 May some polish fag set up a thread 'this is Poland thread. Never 4get it.' Polish people caught up the idea quickly and began to write in their moonspeak about things you will never be able to know about without knowledge of this crazy language. Thread was up for hours, since no one sleeps in Poland.

:A nonsense forced meme created by the [[Fag#Tripfag|tripfag]] Sempai's Pleasurous Nutrients, consisting of a pig inside a right triangle. Rarely seen meme, created one night for no apparent reason, as it applies to nothing other then Pork Slope. Other incarnations include a pork delivery truck driving up a snow covered mountain slope. Usually seen in text form as a response to junk threads or to simply post in legendary threads.

;pupu
:Legendary saint of /c/. pupu never posts with a tripcode, and every thread posted is filled without exception with exceptionally beautiful, high-resolution art of cute anime girls, often culled from [[2chan]]. It is unknown whether pupu is male or female, or even if pupu is one person or a group of people, as pupu never posts a word in any thread, and responds to requests for sources only with the url needed to fulfill the request. Worshipped with nearly god-like status on /c/ and /e/.

;pushrods
:A /o/ meme that was started due to a eurofag [[Anonymous]] in a thread about Corvettes. The original poster said "Why do you Americans like to use outdated technology?", then the eurofag [[Anonymous]] mentioned above posted "pushrods, pushrods, lol". It once rivaled hoodpins as /o/'s most posted meme, and likewise was often combined with the hoodpins meme in the form of "hoodrods, pushpins, lol", or photoshopping the VTEC logo on an overhead valve engine.

;Pyramid Head
:Name of the appropriately named monsterfucker from Silent Hill 2, has a wide fanbase on [[/b/]]. As of the release of the Silent Hill movie, GIFs have spread their way around 4chan, showing the popular monster's antics in the movie. Ususally seen in images associated with RAPE. Also shopped as "Pussy Head". Hailed as a God of Rape.

; Radio Free 4chan
: One day W.T. Snacks stickied a thread about his podcasting show, Midnight Snacks, which was featuring moderator "5" at the day. It was apparently un-stickied by moot, only to be stickied again by Snacks, or possibly 5. At [[/b/]], all of this led to many calls of "BRING BACK SNACKS", and rumors of mod wars circulated. Snacks and 5 responded to this by calling the show "Radio Free 4chan" for the night, in a revolutionary/underground/subversive manner. Episode may have caused 5 to lose his moderator powers, that is, if he has ever had any. IT'S ALL VERY UNCERTAIN.

;Relevant to my interests
:Used on /u/ to describe any thread featuring characters from the anime ''Maria-sama Ga Miteru'' or "Marimite". Since the Marimite girls are often posted in non-sexual or non-romantic pictures, which is technically off-topic, the pictures can be explained away by the poster or respondants as "this is relevant to my interests"; this is because the show itself is so full of lesbian undertones that just posting pictures of the girls automatically makes the thread lesbian, even if the girls are not even looking at each other. Occasionally used to describe threads from other animes with yuri undertones such as ''My HiME'' and ''Kannazuki no Miko''. It has since become a common reply on all boards to pics (especially if tits are shown) that Anonymous approves of.

; Serenity
: [[/b/]]'s new favorite blue-haired girl, the protagonist of a Christian-themed "Amerimanga". The anti-sex plot of the manga combined with Serenity's bad-girl attitude and stunning good looks made her an easy target for lewd Photoshops and original porn, which [[/b/]] did not fail to deliver on. The scientific term for Serenity porn is "serenity porns".

; Shiny Pidgey
: A rare variation of the flying Pokemon, Pidgey. Unlike normal Pokemon, the "shiny" variety have a 1/8192 chance to appear in the games. The shiny Pidgey was used in a [[:Category:Copypasta|copypasta]] where an unfortunate man has his Nintendo DS thrown against the wall by his girlfriend when he encountered said Pokemon. With his DS broken (this causes some speculation towards the truth of the story, as Nintendo products can normally endure much worse abuse and still be functional), he was unable to catch the shiny Pidgey, becomes enraged and hits his girlfriend by "accident", which causes her to leave him. This copypasta usually becomes an issue of debate because some /b/tards argue that the loss of a shiny Pokemon is a greater loss than losing a girlfriend.

[[Image:Shiznat.jpg|thumb|Natsuki (left) and Shizuru (right): /u/ know what to do.]]
; Shiznat
: Shorthand for the yuri coupling of Shizuru Fujino and Natsuki Kuga, two of the heroines of the animes ''My HiME/Otome'' and the closest thing to an actual canon lesbian couple in the show. Reposted on /u/ in greater numbers than any other couple, yet detested by many users who either harbor a personal dislike for Shizuru due to her being an "insane homicidal molestor dyke" or think Natsuki should be with another girl such as Nao or Mai. It invites further scorn due to the fact that in the middle of the already ugly situation in the gigantic orgy of formulaic, lousy writing and circle-jerk softball reviewing that is Fanfiction.net, the HiME section is approximately 99.5% the same contrived, corny and insipid Shiznat fanfiction written by obsessed 16 year old fangirls trying to convince themselves they're gay. While Shiznat is ambiguous and fan conjecture in ''HiME'' (Natsuki tells Shizuru directly she doesn't feel the same way Shizuru does and looks frequently disturbed or even terrified by Shizuru's advances), in ''Otome'' it's pretty much a given they're a lesbian couple considering they sleep in the same bed, spend nearly every waking moment around each other and are clearly on a touchy-feely level of relationship (although Natsuki has her moments with Nao and Mai as well, and Shizuru gets quite 'familiar' with Tomoe).

;Singing Shark, The
:A 4 panel comic about a shark that... well, sings.  The dialogue, in it's entirety, is: "i'm a shark!!!/i'm a SHAAAARK!/suck my diiiiick!/I'M A SHAAARK!!"  No one knows its origin but its nonsensicle nature makes it amusing, nonetheless.  [the origin for the Singing Shark was the Webcomics subforum of the Hockey Zombie comic.]

;Sispuri.swf
:A legendary Flash occasionally reposted to /f/ featuring a bouncy, catchy pop song sung by a bunch of cute, energetic sounding Japanese girls. The hook is that the lyrics are raunchy enough to make 50 Cent do a double take--the girls spend the whole song singing about how, in the words of a Japanese-speaking Anonymous, "they want their big brother to f**k them in every possible way." Given the number of references to male and female genitalia and sexual acts, squeals of passion and pleasure, and repeated cries of ''"Kimochiii!"'' (That feels good!) and ''"Onii-chan, Icchau!"'' (Big Brother, I'm coming!) heard during the song (the lyrics appear onscreen in Japanese as the words are sung), this appears to be an accurate assessment of the song's lyrical content.

:The girls spend the first verse trying to entice their brother into bed, the first chorus is about giving blowjobs and swallowing semen; in the second verse and chorus, the girls sing about how much they love cock and giving titfucks; the girls give a play-by-play of the actual sex act during the breakdown rap, and conclude with the final chorus, in which they sing about orgasms and anal sex. The breakdown rap can automatically be skipped to any time before it plays by clicking on the picture of the girls in the background.

:Sispuri.swf is sometimes referred to as "The 'Double Princess' of /f/", because despite repeated pleas for a full English translation of the lyrics and known websites at which the complete lyrics are available in Japanese, no one has stepped forwards to attempt it, and some Japanese-speaking posters have flat-out refused to translate it just to piss Anonymous off.

His YouTube videos are devoted entirely to how fantastic his body is and how he wins internets for supposedly owning a forum on bodybuilding.com and, according to him, Anonymous.

He also says he doesn't care what people say in comments to him, and yet he disables comments anyway.

;Snakes on a Plane
:From the pending Samuel L. Jackson movie of the same name, which came out in August 2006. Spawned the catchphrase "WE GOT SNAKES ON A MOTHERFUCKING PLANE," from a faux movie poster created using MS Paint. This was widespread enough that a line based on it, "I have ''had'' it with these ''motherfucking'' snakes on this ''motherfucking'' plane!", was actually used by Jackson's character in the film. Popular variations include, but are by no means limited to, "Snape on a Plane," "Snacks on a Plane," and "Snake's on a Plane.", referring to the hero of Metal Gear Solid, Solid Snake. 

;Snape Kills Dumbledore

;Snapesnogger
:A user on DeviantArt. Not really a target of spamming by [[/b/]], but more a source of ridicule for a small group of [[/b/|/b/tards]], as she is pretty much the ultimate obnoxious weeaboo "artist". She has an obsession with Severus Snape (he killed Dumbledore and is the Half Blood Prince), Nagas (snake people) and male pregnancy. She also thinks she is absolutely fantastic as an artist, having decided not to go to art college as she thought she was too good for it, and also refuses to take negative critique on her "deviations", having actually disabled that function. Unfortunately, seeing that all she can really draw is anime-based stuff lacking noses, she soon found out her art wasn't as good as she though after it was ripped to pieces on a professional artist forum. She tried in vain to defend her pieces of art, but ended up basically telling the artists "no, you are wrong, my art IS good". Not such a good idea on a forum where realistic art is the main subject.

:On August 9 2006, a supposed anonymous hacker managed to hack her account and replace her journal with images of tubgirl and "I AM AN EMO FAGGOT" written hundreds of times, replace her password and also ban her from the site. The results were posted on [[/b/]]. It eventually turned out he did not hack her account at all, but managed to presuade her to change her password to a certain number combination, apparently to prevent "MySQL Injection" attacks from /b/tards. Which was pretty fucking stupid of her.

;SPARTAAAAAAA!
:A meme started on December 12th, 2006. The original thread started with a picture of the character Leonidus from the motion picture Frank Miller's ''300'', caught in a shouting pose. An anonymous poster then created a template of the image and placed it over a set of Italian landscape photographs that were being used in the attempted forced meme "Osaka is Italian". From there, the template was used in a photoshop frenzy that resulted in hundreds of Sparta-based shops within a matter of hours. Last but not least, the Sparta craze ended (almost) after this [http://youtube.com/watch?v=ehQAuWYuCso movie] was created. [http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/25980903/sparta/]

;Speedycat
:Speedycat originated from the #4chan chatroom from "Speedchat" or "Speedychat", a term used to describe excess spamming in the chatroom, or people generally typing too fast at the same time, and the badly sung song "Speedycat" from the beatmaniaIIDX series which happens to be entirely in Engrish. From this, an idea to draw a new cat meme for 4chan was put forward. One member decided to take this idea further and created a short looping flash animation involving a bright yellow cat flying across the night sky with the song "Speedycat" playing in the background. Upon clicking the moon the cat would hit "Warp Speed" in which the cat would be seen flying through bright flashing lights to a sped up version of "Speedycat".

;Spicy Hot Loligasms
:Unknown first appearance on 4chan. Made popular by an animated gif of 4 loli cheerleaders with pompoms with this text. One source states that this is from Habanero-tan's comic where she rubs her nether regions with some habanero powder and collapses. Very frequent comment on pictures of the two main females from the magical girl series "Pretty Cure". On a side note: "Loligasms" is sometimes interchanged with "Bukigasms". Buki Buki himself is known for posting high quality images of mostly loli content on 4chan... and never using a tripcode. Some of his posts include exclamations such as "hot" so it's possible that his comments and his love of lolis were the inspiration for this meme.

A stickied post can be identified by the small blue tack next to the normal header. On most boards, posts get stickied because they are particularly interesting or relevant, or just as the mods' ephemeral whims see fit.

;Stoop Kid
:Stoop Kid is a character from the first season of the Nick series Hey Arnold who appears in only one episode.  Made famous as a kid who lives on a stoop and shouts at people walking by for looking at his stoop, touching his stoop, or going near his stoop.  Eventually he is teased by the other kids when they find out he's afraid to leave his stoop.  The rest of the episode consists of the main character, Arnold, helping stoop kid leave his stoop for the first time.  The meme had a small following for a short time on /b/, but it died quickly.  Since then it's come back from time to time, sometimes with photoshops changing the chant from said episode "Stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop!" to "Stoop kid's afraid to shoop his woop."  Stoop kid is now a meme is now a meme is now a meme.

:A drawing of a skinny scantly dressed pothead girl with dark green hair, a giant bong on her back, a utilitybelt of drugs, and a happy look on her face. TCC means "The Crackhead Clubhouse" which is part of the Something Awful message forum and TCC-tan was created and posted in the The Crackhead Clubhouse in early 2004 by Vanessie. The image was slightly altered and had the TCC on her shirt removed and Vanessie's name was removed also. TCC-tan was posted repeatedly on 4chan's [[/b/]] by [[Anonymous]] in late 2005 advertising a just starting out 4chan like imageboard 420chan. Whenever the altered TCC-tan image was posted on 4chan's [[/b/]] it would go with "Dearest [[/b/]] please visit 420chan.org." and harsh criticism would follow and sometimes posting attacks/floods of pictures, gifs, diaper fetish pictures, stupid sayings, and offensive remarks. But most of the time the floods consisted of child pornography on 420chan which made 420chan's /cp and /pedo boards come to be. In the months that followed the pothead girl was dubbed TCC-chan which is a slight variation of her original name TCC-tan but everybody in [[/b/]] calls everyone and everything a "chan" even though "chan" means a male and "tan" means a female. Eventually TCC-tan became 420chan's adopted mascot and had many fans and fan art drawn by people from 4chan and 420chan and now whenever TCC-tan is posted on 4chan's [[/b/]], it either goes with "Dearest [[/b/]] please visit 420chan.org", CP FLOOD ON 420CHAN, talk about getting some flapjacks AKA pancakes (TCC-tan's favorite food), or TCC-tan fan art.

;Take It Slave
:meme that originated in late 2004 as a photoshop of one of the 2chan characters with the text "TAKE IT SLAVE" written in the Halo font. The character's face was then photoshopped onto any image present on [[/b/]], from previous memes or attempted memes (Reidick and Milhouse are two examples) to a photo of a young adult grimacing while taking a photo of himself in the mirror. This re-emerged a few times more a couple of weeks later, a resurgence caused by obnoxious [[/b/]]tards, before going underground.

;Test
:A Wrestler formerly with the World Wide Wrestling. Sometimes a post randomly occurs on many futaba style boards where the message body contains only the word "test". This is usually caused by a new user trying to understand how the board software works.

:Self-explanatory meme. Sometimes rendered as U FAIL IT or YOU FAIL IT. From Engrish in the Neo-Geo game "Blazing Star", where the whole phrase was "You fail it! Your skill is not enough, see you next time, bye-bye!"

;UGHHHHH NIGGA BEAST IT
:Was quite popular in 2005 (though it may have been only one person trying to force it through the entire year); was usually added to the end of sex-related posts, more often than not in FULL CAPS.

;Usako Man
: The bane of 4chan. Also known as "Usako Man Z" & "Usucko" His art is posted on /b/, /co/, /v/ and at one time /h/. An even worse version of Andy. Terror,disgust, "WTF is this shit?!" and "Fuck you Internet, fuck you" is the response from Anonymous whenever they see Usako. His doujins usually involve him being "raped" by the female video game characters and occasionally giving April o'Neil some anal action, much to the dismay of /co/. The real kicker to this is that he's married IRL to a "better" artist named Kitty.

;USA won FIFA! (Get over it!)
: A new meme for a new board. /sp/ by its nature is the natural battleground between Eurofags and Amerifags. This fight is most often illustrated by the Football (Soccer) vs [Insert American Sport Here]. With bitching between Eurofags and Amerifags usually resulting in Eurofags saying "Noone else plays your sports!" followed by Amerifags saying "Who'd want to be good at your poor people's/faggy sport?!" Amerifags, having seen team USA lose to both Spain and England badly at soccer, then were given the greatest gift of all. They tied 0-0 with FIFA Ranked #1 team Argentina. Afterwards, all Amerifags trolls on /sp/ christened soccer 'Ameriball' (sic) and declared that the USA had 'WON FIFA!'. Failing to realise that a tie does not equal a win in soccer or that Argentina were not the official world champions (Italy). When Eurofags attempted to explain/bawww at the Amerifags about them having not won anything the meme took hold and has been repeated ad infinitum ever since. Especially with threads about the European Championships 2008 dominating the board over the summer. USA Won FIFA is the rallying cry for all Amerifags on /sp/, it is doubtful that it will spread to other boards.

;Vanessa Hudgens
:Star of Disney's inexplicably popular "High School Musical" movie series. Became an /s/ meme when she decided to show her tits rather than GTFO, and the pics ended up on the Internets. For a few days, every other post in /s/ seemed to either contain the pics or a request for them. Vanessa Hudgens also seems to have become /s/'s [[/v/#Battletoads|Battletoads]]: a stock reply to any request for an unknown model's name.

;V-Dub
:Forced meme started on /b/ with multiple pictures of Peter Stormare as "V-Dub" from the recent Volkswagon commercials, followed by the text "V-DUB IS A MEME" posted in mass.

; We Can't Stop Here. This Is Bat Country.
: Considered by many to be the funniest post on [[/b/]], ever. The single image macro features two cats in a car, one driving, and the other dressed as Hunter S. Thompson. The phrase comes from Thompson's novel and the movie translation "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas".

; [[Weeaboo]]

; [[/v/#POWER_WRIST|WE'RE GOING BACK TO POTATOS TO GET MY FUKING POWER WRIST]]

; What a tweest!
: A sarcastic remark regarding to any plot with a ridiculous over-the-top plot twist. Originated from script writer M. Night Shyamalan, who is well known for writing "The Sixth Sense".

; [[Castlevania|What is a man?]]

[[Image:Dawn and T.gif|thumb|what happened with Dawn and T.]]
; WHAT HAPPENED WITH DAWN AND T?
: Was a desperate cry heard from all /b/tards when a user posted erotic fiction but instead of finishing with bel-air stopped half way and watched all of 4chan go insane. 

; What is Love?
: Popular flash parody of the popular SNL parody of A Night at the Roxbury. Involves Will Ferrel, Cris Kattan, and Jim Carrey head-banging in their car to the song 'What is Love' by Haddaway.

; WHERE IS SARAH CONNOR
: From "The Terminator". Usage on [[/b/]] seems to be completely random. [[/b/]]tards have created the myth that some obscure word or phrase is [[wordfilter]]ed into the phrase, but it was just made up to confuse newbies. Usually injected in the middle of a lowercase word, e.g. "I am not a furWHERE IS SARAH CONNOR".

; WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?
: Implies that the something, usually to say an accompanying image or the one being replied to is so horrible that its very existance implies either the non-existence of God or that God has abandoned you (leaving you to the whims of whatever horrible thing is in the picture). Usually seen around "The King" or other creepy things; not as strong as "DO NOT WANT". See [http://elitemrp.net/wiyg/ "The King"].

; Where's the funny?
: A common response to jokes, webcomics, etc that aren't remotely humorous. Probably derived from the ancient "Where's the beef?" meme, which came from a famous string of Wendy's commercials from the early 1980s.

; WHITE WOMAN MAKE ME SICK
: A phrase once posted [[Anonymous]]ly in response to a photos of a white woman in /s/. It, or variants of it (BLACK WOMAN, etc) is now often used to mock those who complain when an "ugly" non-Asian picture is posted in /s/..

; Whoops! Can't show that in a Christian manga!
: meme derived from the american-made manga "Serenity". Used in the manga to censor something which, as stated, couldn't be shown in the family-friendly manga. Was shopped over porn, guro, etc.

; [[/a/#Why is she Such a Slut?|Why is she such a slut?]]

; WIKIPEDIA SAID IT WAS TRUE SO DONT ARGUE
: Attempt at seeding a new meme. Self-explanatory. Commonly used along with [[LURK MORE]]. Not of much currency now that Wikipedia refers all discussion of 4chan memes to this page. Thus, this meme has essentially been absorbed into LURK MORE, though it still sees occassional use to insist that any dubious claim is true because a Wikipedia article says so (usually after vandalizing the article).

; WikiWorld
: The previous location of this list of memes and events. WikiWorld's 4chan page was removed because (according to the site's [http://wikiworld.com/wiki/index.php/User:KenSchry epic failure of an admin]) it's a "''family oriented website''" and even '''mentioning''' subjects like rape and child porn is forbidden. [http://wikiworld.com/wiki/index.php/Talk:4chan] WikiWorld's 4chan page (now blanked) is the only page on their entire site other than the main page that actually generates Google hits, illustrating what an irrelevant failure the rest of the site is.

[[Image:yaranaika_faces.png|thumb|right|The Yaranaika faces.]]
; Yaranaika
: From "Kuso Miso Technique", a yaoi (gay porn) manga which starts with a guy named Masaki getting hit on by a strange man (Takakazu Abe) in a jumpsuit while walking through a park; "yaranaika" translates as "Shall we do it?" and is Jumpsuit Guy's de facto catchphrase, and "Uho Ii otoko!" ('Whoa, nice guy!' or more loosely "Hey, good lookin'!") is the first thing he says to Masaki. One of its notable features is the highly exaggerated look of the protagonists' faces, especially while having sex, which made it a huge hit on 2chan; Masaki's and Jumpsuit Guy's faces (both normal and in various states of sexual arousal) were shopped onto just about everything imaginable. This, of course, spread to [[/b/]] and became popular there as well.

; Yet Another X Thread
: Where X is whatever new anime of the season is making the rounds. /a/ typically adopts one popular show and makes multiple threads of the series.  Tends to annoy anyone who dislikes the show, and complain it clutters up the board with no relevant discussion. Shows are usually considered fads if discussion and posting dies off very quickly after a show is over.

; Y HELO THAR
: Popular meme appearing in autumn of 2004, first seen photoshopped onto a picture of a person talking on a telephone with an exaggerated silly facial expression. Sometimes seen as Y HELO THAR BUTTSECKS? More popular format is Y HALO THAR - normally this is photoshopped onto a random image or a photo of Master Chief. Some popular examples feature an owl or Kryten from the UK TV series Red Dwarf.

; Y HALO 2 U
: An image macro of the halo 2 logo, with obvious changes to make the meme.

; Yomi is erotic
: Another frequent response to threads about Yomi from Azumanga Daioh, especially in /e/, /h/ and /u/. Occasionally adapted for other characters from the show, such as: Chiyo is cute, Sakaki is sexy, Kaorin is lesbo, etc. See also: Azumanga Daioh.

; [[Yotsuba]]

; YOU BETTER BRING YO NIKEZ
: A spin off of various shops and memes, where instead of the typical text, it is edited as "YOU BETTER BRING YO NIKEZ". This originated from a photoshop of OVER NINE THOUSAND where Vegeta says fore-mentioned text.

; [[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|You have destroyed most of a small galaxy. Please pick your words with greater care.]]

; YOU GONNA GET RAPED
: Very self-explanatory. Almost always capitalized. Often accompanied by pics of freaky-looking older men or "The King".

; [[Fate/stay night#...You Lost Me.|...You Lost Me.]]

; YOUR LOCAL CHINK
: Namefag whose entire purpose in life apparently is to flood /a/ threads with Touhou pictures, even when the thread itself is about something completely different. Loved by Touhou fans, hated by just about everybody else.

; Your resistance only makes my penis harder
: From the hentai anime Words Worth. Self-explanatory.

[[image:Ytmnd_HP.JPG|thumb|The YTMND Homepage]]
; YTMND
: You're The Man Now, Dog. Usually animated gifs on a tiled background with music, usually to point out something stupid. Often accused of steal content from 4chan, the most notable being the "O Rly?" owl, which originated on 4chan. More recently, YTMND has become both the ally and rival of 4chan's Habbo Hotel raiders.
