Project Name (So its googleable) : AnonFreq

Potential name: TheNetwork, AnonymousFreqency

Concept:
Global Freqency style comic with culture of Anonymous thrown in.

The idea is to have a comic where a network of hackers and citizens (and sometimes government agents) all working together to solve problems too big for governments themselves to handle.

There is no central leader this time (but each mission can have minders), but there is i2p networks for communications, there is bitcoin funding/donation towards 'missions' (bit like kickstarter, but anonymous and for 'actions'). 

The non reoccouring characters (Who may be the 'agents', 'funders', 'planners', 'mission control', or even just online bystanders) are from all walks of life, outside of the action or planning, they are your office workers, students, professionals, writers, and sometimes even actual intelligence agents (paper pushers or fieldwork).

Reoccouring characters could be the 'mission controls' volunteers who are known only by their 'voice' and online nicks. (and even they can sometimes be killed or decomissioned faster than normal hero characters)

To make it compelling, you need to show some highconcept ideas, also you need plots that pushes what you would usally think of (think of how scifi push many ideas we consider as normal before... e.g. racism).

Also don't make the organisation utopic. Sometimes such anonymous action groups can have weakness that makes it lose a mission, maybe even catastrophically. Maybe some mission would have different AnonFreq agents going against eachother, due to some screwup in the planning process (or factional wars).

Or maybe such group because they tend to be 'anonymous' does something cruel. These topic needs to be probed.

Format:
Each picture should be arranged in inkscape (you can still import pictures into it), its easier to fix any problems as its vector. Also inkscape is free, so more people can come and assist (even if its just translation work) 

The comic pages should at the end of each 'episode', show a text of the 'story outline'. The episode name instead of using a "no#", would instead have a md5 hash of the story outline. The file name of such episode should also include the hash. This will make it easier to google the story outline.

Hopefully we can have a central database so we can properly assign 'issue numbers' alongside with the 'hash'





Good luck and hope to see something like this soon ;)



Based off:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Frequency

The Global Frequency is an independent, covert intelligence organization headed by a former intelligence agent who uses the alias of Miranda Zero. There are reportedly 1,001 people on the Global Frequency, forming an active smart mob communicating by specially modified video mobile phones through a central dispatch system coordinated by a young woman code-named Aleph.

The purpose of the organization is to protect and rescue the world from the consequences of the various secret projects that the governments of the world have established, which are unknown to the public at large. The people on the Global Frequency are chosen and called on for their specialized skills in a variety of areas, from military personnel, intelligence agents, police detectives to scientific researchers, academics, athletes, former criminals and assassins. These threats that the organization deals with are equally varied and usually world-threatening, ranging from rogue military operations and paranormal phenomena to terrorist attacks and religious cults.

The existence of the organization is an open secret, but its membership list is anonymous, the identities of its field agents unknown to even each other before they meet on a mission. Often the only way to tell a member of the Global Frequency is by the phones that they carry or the Global Frequency symbol—a circle with four points on its perimeter 90 degrees apart—that they sport somewhere on their person.

Who exactly funds the Global Frequency is not known. Zero has said that at least some of the money comes from the G8 governments who pay the Frequency for not revealing the various secret horrors they deal with. Although the presence of an independent, unaccountable agency with strike capability makes some authorities nervous, they also recognize the fact that the Frequency has the skills, the reach and, more importantly, the will to act where they cannot. As a result, the organization gets tacit approval for its activities, and is sometimes called on by governments to deal with extraordinary crises. Mostly, however, the organization acts proactively as it discovers such threats.

Ellis designed the comic series like a television series with standalone "episodes", allowing the reader to begin with any issue and be able to understand what was going on. As a result, the only regular characters in the series are Miranda Zero and Aleph, with only a few other characters making a reappearance in the twelfth issue of the series. This also heightened the suspense, as the reader did not know if these characters would survive the mission, which sometimes they did not.
