Here is the basic way of making crêpes, it will be re-used in most crêpe related recipes, when the recipe requires a slightly different version it will (and will have to) be specified.
When they get added, spongy 'American style' pancakes should go into their own section 'pancakes' while crêpes and traditional pancakes belong here.

## Basic crêpe

### Ingredients

For 12 crêpes (I've only been able to make 4-5 out of this but I was messing with the process a bit):
You will need:
* 150g of flour.
  * for galettes replace or mix with buckwheat flour.
* 2 big eggs.
* 15cl of milk.
* 10cl of water.
* 1 pinch of salt.
* 1 big spoon of olive oil.
* 1 big spoon of sugar.
  * for salted crepes or galettes replace by 1 pinch of salt.

### Directions

1. In a big bowl, put all the ingredients except the water and milk.
2. With a whip, mix while adding the milk until you obtain a smooth paste.
3. Cover the bowl with a cloth and let it rest for 2hours.
  * Not mandatory, but allows to make thinner and lighter crepes.
4. Put in the water to dilute the paste.
  * At this moment you can add some flavor of your choice, such as alcohol, vanilla, coffee, etc.
5. Grease the pat with butter or oil and pour 1 ladle of paste.
6. Cook 1mn on the first side, and 30 seconds on the other.
