Sky's The Limit is a phrase used, accompanied by a picture with a blank space, to encourage a photoshop thread. One of the most common templates for such pictures is Gendo Ikari.

== Memes ==
=== Blank Check ===
A picture of a black & white male anime character, drawn by manga-ka Higuri You, was posted, but with the facial features photoshopped out, with the message, "I've given you a blank check, go crazy." Hundreds of edits were made of this picture, using memes such as Koffing, [[Cockmongler]], V and Tom being used to fill in the face area. The faceless character been given the name Doppelganger because of the fact that so much of the art is of past and present [[4chan]] memes and can be considered a look into 4chan's glorious past.
