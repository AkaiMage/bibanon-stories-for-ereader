'''Misty''' is a poorly [[forced meme]]. Someone posted around five pictures of the character Misty, of the short-lived Bomberman anime, asking if fapping to Misty makes him a [[furry]]. This is usually followed by familiar memes such as [[Cover-Tom]]. This is probably because they're basically the same premise.
