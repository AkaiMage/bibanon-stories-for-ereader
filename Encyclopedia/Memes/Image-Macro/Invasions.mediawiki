On many occasions, [[/b/]] gets a strong urge to go about and invade other websites. On this page, we will do our best to document said invasions.

'''Note to those adding new invasion entries:''' This page is only a placeholder until all Invasions are on their own pages. Please refrain from plopping invasions here: Give each new invasion its own page and add it to the [[:Category:Invasions|Invasions]] category!

== Imageboard Invasions ==
Due to a script known as [[curl]] surfacing that allowed the flooding of imageboards, Imageboard Invasions are gaining popularity.

== Forum Invasions ==
Forum Invasions are the most common type of invasions started by /b/tards. They can result from a variety of sources, whether it be bored /b/tards, people on forums dissing 4chan or an existing grudge against the forums or their goals. However, most invasions that start that way are usually the result of somebody getting banned from said forum and trying to turn 4chan into a personal army to attack the site. Luckily, most of the time, invasions that start this way never go very far.

=== Biblocality ===
Run by Troy, a freaky neo-Christian who seems to know everything and anything about God and the Bible.  He even wrote an essay that "proved" the existance of God and challanged anyone to disprove it.  The reward was $10,000.  Many tried but Troy used his twisted cause/effect logic to disprove them.  Not only that, he banned anyone who tried because their arguements went against his beliefs.  /b/ would not take this sitting down.  A huge force invaded his site, posting all manner of filthy porn and sacreligious statements.  Troy quickly employed his ban-hammer, but was harassed in his chatroom for weeks afterwards.

A little while later, /b/ learned that Troy was recieving threatening phone calls and e-mails.  He cited 4chan as a possible source.  Apparently, it turned out to be another crazy neo-Christian.

Since that day, pictures of Troy, along with his exact address and aerial pictures of his house have been posted.  He has tightened his forums even further, effectively making it a one-man show.  Further invasions are unlikely, due to lack of interest and nigh-impossible sign-up procedures.

=== eBaum's World ===
eBaum's World has made itself famous with the internet by stealing content from other sites, such as [[YTMND]], [[Something Awful]] and [[Fark]] and posting it on EW, making thousands of dollars from ad sales (of course, it could be argued that all of these stolen images and flash pieces originated from [[4chan]] in the first place, since [[4chan]] gives birth to 99% of internet [[meme]]s). It is quite unpopular.

In January 2006, a soon to be infamous animation depicting multiple photos of [http://lohanfacial.ytmnd.com/ Lindsay Lohan] in sequence appeared on [[YTMND]], courtesy of [[YTMND]] user SpliceVW. eBaum's World took this animation, put it on their own site and slapped an EW watermark on it. Upon hearing news of this, users from [[YTMND]] joined users from other internet communities, namely Something Awful, LUElinks, Newgrounds, FARK, Weebls-Stuff, IGN, and of course, [[4chan]]. The combined forces of these sites all swooped down on the EW forums, chat room and tech support, launching nasty ping floods, spam attacks and DDoS attacks. These groups raided the eBaum's World forums with spam posts and DDoS attacks. Eventually Max Goldberg, the owner of [[YTMND]], and Bauman of EW came to an agreement, with Bauman removing the montage from his website, in return for Goldberg removing any reference to "eBaum" from his website. Despite the resolution of the conflict, both sites experienced DDoS attacks on the morning of January 12, 2006.

Though it wasn't a [[4chan]]-led invasion, many [[/b/]]tards have taken it upon themselves that during raids on other forums and sites, they will claim they are from eBaum's World in order to direct counterattacks that way.

=== Gaia Online ===
Early [[4chan]] raids typically took place on Gaia Online, due to Gaia's position as the largest forum on the internet at the time. Many [[/b/]]tards started off their raiding careers on Gaia Online.

Gaia Online raids are notable in the fact that nobody cares about them anymore, because the populace of Gaia tends to have such a low IQ that they pretty much troll themselves now. However, now and then you will still see INVADE GAIA threads on [[/b/]].

=== Meez.com ===
In June 18, 2007, /i/ has [http://www.lurkmore.com/wiki/index.php?title=Meez successfully raided the Meez forum], flooding almost all the sections, which forced the forum to be taken down the next day. Meez is a website that allows users to create their own animated avatars of faggotry. Much like the Habbo raid, every invader was a nigra with an afro. Apparently, the moderators were unable to (or had no idea how to) ban accounts, which made the invasion very easy.

== Blog Invasions ==
Blog invasions are rarer because it is harder to raid a blog. Many times, all the owner of the blog has to do is turn on comment moderation, or even just disable comments and the main brunt of the raid is stopped. However, many times the comment moderation queues on these blogs are filled with spam posts by /b/tards, which keeps the blog owners from noticing legit comments, or accidently allowing bad comments to be posted to the site.

=== Feminist Blog Invasions ===
:* ''Main Article: [[Feminist Blog Invasions]]''

== Petition & Pledge List Invasions ==
Petition and Pledge List invasions are good for novice /b/tard raiders because they are so simple to raid. They usually consist of filling the fields on the petition/pledge form with bogus info and 4chan memes, and hitting submit. Some sites have enabled scripts that restrict signing the Petition/Pledge list to once per IP. However, many /b/tards will enable proxies or use CGI-Proxy sites to get around this.

=== No Porn Pledge ===
:* ''Main Article: [[No Porn Pledge]]''

== Other Invasions ==
These raids really don't fit in any other category. They range from attacking virtual communities, game worlds, radio/TV call-in shows and even real-world invasions.

=== ChaCha ===
ChaCha is a search engine heavily raided. [http://www.trendpediawiki.com/ChaCha Long conversation archive of ChaCha raiding.]

=== DeviantArt ===
Not so much raiding the site itself but more spamming artists that they simply don't like. Whether they be crappy weeaboo artists who think they're too good for art college (when all they draw is generic chibi anime crap) or art thiefs, [[/b/]] sometimes assembles to bring down it's army upon the "artist" in question.

Due to the mass amount of DA raids that happen courtesy of /b/ and /i/, cataloging them here would be an amazing task.

=== Hal Turner ===
Hal Turner is a reformed faggot coke head turned white supremacist who hates Jews and other minorities even more so than the denizens of /b/.  

On December 20th, 2006, Hal Turner was supposed to air his final talk show, allegedly due to a lack of funding. As such, a massive 7chan/4chan/YTMND/SA raid was planned to show Hal what the world really thought of him. Due to having such hurt feelings, good ole Hal decided to do the intelligent, adult thing and post all the prank callers' phone numbers on his website, encouraging his fan base to strike back. Since many of the calls were made using CID-spoofing techniques with Linux technology, most of the numbers were invalid. Some of them, however, need to LURK MOAR and belonged to minors. Soon, a few of Hal's more educated neanderthals were able to transform a few of the phone numbers into addresses in the comments section of his website.

More drama ensued, and Bantown ruin legends were tapped to compile and deploy Hal Turner's dox. This included his criminal record, housing details, former locations of residence, and detailed personal information. Among these neat little facts was Hal's real home phone number, culled from public records.

A weeaboo fag known only as "woah", aka Benedict Arnold, then phoned Hal to let him know of his imminent ruin. 

As Hal did not comply with the simple request of removing the phone numbers from his website, his detailed documentation was released to /b/tards and /b/rothas, and was posted to full-disclosure, as is Bantown Standard Operating Procedures. Allegedly after this information was released, over 150 calls were made to Hal thanks to the miracles of Linux and BSD. 

Hal quickly folded, and removed the information from his website. While this would usually mean victory for the channers, one must understand that the point had to be driven home. Calls to his residence continued until Hal and his wife stopped picking up the phone. During this time, all content was removed from Hal's website and replaced with the text "Merry Christmas." Additionally, the dox given to CHAN ENTERPRISES LLC. were posted to several White Power forums (one of the largest of which is http://www.stormfront.org), leading to much ridicule of Hal, even by his own supposed fan base.

More drama ensued on December 25th, when it was determined that Hal's family was celebrating white supremacy and Christmas at Hal's father's residence. Hal's father's dox were quickly obtained and deployed to the internets. Some details are unclear at this time; however, there are some theories that Hal's wife kicked him out of his own house. Hal has begun posting death threats against the people involved in his ruining, prolonging the lulz even more.

In the time between the first raid and December 27th, many benevolent Anonymous took it upon themselves to send Hal some Christmas gifts as a gesture of good-will, including DHL shipping boxes, pornography, pizza, copies of the Koran, trap hookers, tampons, free meals from Meals on Wheels, a Cadillac from Enterprise car rentals, and all other sorts of useful materials.  Additionally, Anonymous contacted others that could help improve Hal's life, such as the Mormons, the Witnesses of Jehovah, the Church of Scientology, U.S. military recruiters, the Socialst Party, Alcoholics Anonymous, and others.  Anonymous was sure that Hal would appreciate these gifts.  Anonymous also knew about Hal's past bankruptcies, and thought it would be a good idea to help him get some money, by posting his Lexus for sale on Craigslist.  Hal was also trying to free up space in his living room, so his furniture was posted as well as being free to the first to come to his house.

On the night of the 27th, Hal announced live on his show that his financial back was broken as a result of the bandwidth fees incurred by this raid, and that he would have to go cry in his hugbox for a while, before returning to the forum of internet radio faggotry.

In other words:
 NOW THIS IS A STORY ALL ABOUT HAL
 HIS LIFE GOT FLIPPED, TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
 AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE, JUST SIT RIGHT THERE
 I'LL TELL YOU HOW I BECAME THE GUY WHO KNOCKED HAL OFF THE AIR
 
 IN NORTH NEW JERSEY BORN AND RAISED
 HATING NIGGERS IS HOW HE SPENT MOST OF HIS DAYS
 CHILLIN' OUT, MAXIN', AND HATIN' THE JEWS
 AND SHOOTIN' SOME MEXICANS CLOSIN' HIS POOL
 
 WHEN A COUPLE OF GAYS WHO WERE UP TO SOME GOOD
 STARTED MOVIN' INTO HIS NEIGHBORHOOD
 HE SAW HIS DAD GET RAPED AND THEN HAL GOT SCARED
 HE SAID "I'LL KILL THOSE FUCKING FAGGOTS THEN GET ON THE AIR!"
 
 I - PULLED - UP HIS WEB SITE AND THEN I CAME HERE
 THE ADDRESS BAR SAID "/B/" AND THEY WERE THE SITE TO FEAR
 ANONYMOUS HARDLY THINKS THAT HATRED AIN'T FAIR
 BUT HE SAID "NYORO~N! FUCK IT, KNOCK HAL OFF THE AIR!"
 
 SO - HAL'S - SHOW, IT STARTED ABOUT 7 OR 8
 AND WE YELLED TO THE LEGION, "WGET, IT WON'T FAIL 'YA!"
 A SERVER IN FLAMES, WE WERE FINALLY THERE
 THAT WAS THE END, AND NOW HAL'S OFF THE AIR.

=== Harry Potter ===
When the final book of the ''Harry Potter'' series was first released on July 21, 2007, Anonymous made appearances in some bookstores, dressed as a [[nigra]] and using a megaphone to announce leaked spoilers to the children waiting to buy the book.

=== Hot Asian Babe Cams ===
Similar to the Habbo Hotel raids in which there are never any major planned raids. These raids occur whenever annoymous gets bored, and he takes out his problems on this site which features various Asian girls who live their lives in front of web cams but do not do pornography. The site is free but the women reserve the right to block anyone they find offensive or don't like. Anonymous usually makes outragous demands such as 'show us your keyboard', 'put (Random object) on your head' or taunts the women, saying they should find a better line of work then being a cam whore or they are not good looking enough. Some of the time the women break down into tears which causes even more lulz for anonymous. When the woman wises up to anonymous the entire group is banned and they move to their next target. There is usually one Asian Babe Cam thread a day on /b/ where the best moments are screen capped and posted on /b/

One of such raids (done by one person) is shown [http://voter5.info/camgirl-antics.7z here] (download 7zip to extract 7z archives)

=== Snakes on a Plane Theater Invasion ===
An off shot of the Habbo Hotel Invasion that took place during the Premiere of the movie Snakes on a Plane. The major difference was that this /b/tards dressed in suits and wore afro wigs and blocked the entrances to moive theaters with signs say "Pool's Closed Due to AIDS!" or "Theater's Closed Due to Snakes!"

One of the most epic Habbo Hotel raids occured at the Woodfield Mall in Illinois the day after the Snakes on a Plane Theater Invasion, where Habbo Hotel was one of the sponsers of a free concert and had several laptops set up with access to Habbo Hotel. A small detachments of /b/tards came across this by accident and formualted a plan of attack. Since they couldn't outright block the concert because it was open roomed and the large amount of security and local police stationed. They raided the laptops getting IP banned from the Hotel therefore keeping any casual user from being able to use the laptops. All /b/tards managed to escape without prosecution.
