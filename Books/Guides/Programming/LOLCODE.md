Useless, don't bother with it, but if you're that retarded to use this all 10 or so actual commands are on lolcode.com.
If you really wanna know, it's based on LOLCATS. a "Hello world" of this would be:
<pre>
HAI
  CAN HAS STUDIO?
  VISIBLE "Hello World, this programming language sucks ass"
KTHXBAI
</pre>

Really, it's not as bad as you might think, it's just useless in that it is exactly like C with the syntax changed around.
