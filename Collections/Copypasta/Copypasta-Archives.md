This is a list of unarchived [[copypasta]] that we still need.

## Sites

* [[Insurgency Wiki]] - Along with the normal raid collections, it had a small bunch of copypasta from Etherchan and the usual ones. **(DONE)**
* [[Tanasinn.info]] - Has a bunch of Kopipe (2ch copypasta) along with stuff from 4ch and 4chan.
* [[Wikichan]] - The largest library of copypasta that the community of 4chan had ever seen. The site went kaput long ago, but it's still on the internet archive.
* [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] - Has a small, but cool collection.
* [a source of erotic copypasta, also a good place to fap](http://anonym.to/http://www.asstr.org/)
