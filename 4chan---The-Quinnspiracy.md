This is a community-editable report on the shitstorm unleashed by the Zoe Quinn scandal. The scandal has severe implications on the video game journalism industry, and even reveals a troubling insight into the power of forum moderators as gatekeepers of information. 

In response, 4chan’s /v/ and /pol/ , along with other websites (yes, le Reddit) have launched united campaigns to protest the scandal, in a unique new way.

As the situation goes on, we are going to need a solid, well sourced report of all that has happened; it’s truly an unprecedented event in internet history. 

It will also help anons stay up to date without having to ask the thread or read extremely long and dispatriate images.

After this ordeal is over and done, people are going to want to know what happened and why. The wiki should help anyone in the future understand why there was a reform in video game journalism, or why /v/ went to shit, depending on how this all ends.
