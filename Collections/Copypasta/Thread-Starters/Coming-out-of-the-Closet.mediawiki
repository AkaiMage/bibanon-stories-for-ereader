=== Coming out of the Closet ===

I KNOW I WILL REGRET THIS LATER, BUT I CANT HOLD IT IN ANY LONGER. THIS IS THE HARDEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE, AND POSSIBALY THE HARDEST THING I WILL EVER DO, BUT AS OF NOW, I AM OFFICALY COMMING OUT OF THE CLOSET. THATS RIGHT EVERY ONE, IM GAY, IF YOU DONT LIKE IT. DEAL WITH IT. <br />

ok, today is the big day 10/28/07, i just told my mom and dad and they were ok with it..so im coming out to my friends now. so, here is it....I'm Gay. i have a boy friend, i meet him online. on yahoo chat and we met up in real life and..we'll we hit it off really good. and we have been going steady for about 3 months now. he has helped me get threw all the hard times and has showed me how coming out is a good thing because I've been pretty scared about it. i don't know how my friends would treat me. but with the help of Jamal, my lover, i am able to do this. thank you everyone for understanding.
