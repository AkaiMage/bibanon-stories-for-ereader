## The Faceless Horde ##

We are /b/, but are not confined to /b/. Though /b/ is our home we have infected all of 4chan. Whether you are in /a/ or /v/, we are there. We have breached the border of wiki and google. We are spreading, and will continue to do so until all the internet acknowledges that they, in fact, are and always have been one of us. We are terror. We are darkness. We will find you. You will be assimilated, resistance is futile.
