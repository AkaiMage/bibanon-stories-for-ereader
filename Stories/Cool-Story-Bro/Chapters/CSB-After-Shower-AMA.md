Funny you should say that, the policy pay-out and statement came through on friday and "2934.96p" was deposited into my account along with the index prices of everything that was covered... all in all I only paid about 1300 for everything in my apartment originally, most of it was from ebay or stuff people were getting rid of when I moved in and needed things.

I'm probably going to replace everything via ebay and other cheap sites to save as much money as possible again and then use the rest for pizza/beer/curry money.

... maybe buy a new \<spoiler\>shower\</spoiler\>... all this talk of showers is really making me want to go and have a shower.

> Hey OP  
> so why did your ex (Betty I assume) tell the guy where you lived?  
> as a forever alone i am really enjoying the story  
    
Betty is her mothers name, he described me to her and she gave him my name, then he looked me up as it turns out.

And thanks again everyone for following the story! hope you're finding it sufficiently cool!

After reading all of the story posted so far.. seeing that he has quite the active life and is pretty damn alpha... I have to ask.. How the fuck did he end up on /r9k/ for 18 hours a day?

probably has a waterproof smartphone and uses it to enter 4chan while showering

lol notice the long gaps between my posts? I'm usually up to something when that happens, eating, drinking, having a shower, going for a jog, lifting weights etc. I'm quite a solitary man and I don't have many hobbies, I don't even own an xbox or ps3. I had a wii but I got drunk one night and my leg caught around the power cable sending it flying off my set top box on the wall and smashing on the floor, and I actually claimed it on the insurance.

Heheh, I'm covered for accidental damage anyway but I just never got round to it until last week, can't wait to play me some Wii Sports and thee new Zelda: Skyward Sword. I'm actually a mega-huge zelda fag, final fantasy too but not owning a ps3 means not being able to play. From what I've read FF13 was a complete farce anyway and much worse than 12 so I'm not too bothered about playing it. 

If someone put a gun to my head and screamed "WHATS YOUR FAVORITE GAME!" I'd have to say Link To The Past, I played it on an emulator a year ago, and to my surprise I hadn't forgotten a single thing about it and blew through it in less than 5 hours.

Just got out of the shower, for the sake of you guys I timed myself and it seems I take around an hour in there from start to finish, a lot of time is eaten up working on my hair and deep cleansing then moisturizing my face, gotta keep those boyish good looks!

### 1252877

Fucking dan's back. Holy fuck you started posting at 11ish, and thats after you've showered, worked out, eaten, etc. 

I've only just fucking got up at 1pm and have only showered...

You're making me look bad...

### 1252268

OP, you have to have some sort of ocd or something to spend an hour showering each time

### 1252328

\>\>1252306  

\>[The fact] that it takes him an hour is what makes think that [he can't possibly be taking like, what,] 15 a day?

not strange to me anymore, ever since OP started this story i have been taking 40 showers a day

### 1252332

\>\>1252328  
One must wonder, at that level, why even bother getting out?

### 1253126

\>\>1253086  
Dan,it would be nice if you take a picture of your shower so that we know this is real.
It would be appreciated.

### 1253221

POST PIC OF SHOWER WITH TIMESTAMP OR SHOWER NEVER HAPPENED

### 1253316 (OP)

\>\>1253221  
lol I'm not taking pictures of my shower, I imagine your imaginations of the water temple from zelda OOT are way better than the actual shower itself.

In fact, yeah, imagine it as the water temple from Ocarina Of Time, haha.
