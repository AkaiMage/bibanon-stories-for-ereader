The '''barrel roll''' is an aerial combat maneuver in which a fighter plane spins clockwise or counterclockwise while still flying forward. By 2006, the line '''do a barrel roll''', a line that Peppy frequently shouts in the game ''Star Fox 64'', is ubiquitous on [[/b/]]. In the game, your fighter is invincible while barrel rolling.

'''Do a barrel roll''', like '''stick it in her pooper''', is often used as a stock reply when someone asks for advice (usually with the tagline What do I do, [[/b/]]? - a reference to the [[IF THIS IS TRUE THEN HERE IS WHAT YOU DO]] incident) on [[/b/]].

[[Image:Doabarrelroll.gif|thumb|Barrel roll from ''Star Fox 64,'' complete with Peppy's incredibly annoying line.]]Often used during phone-in raids on [[Invasions#TomGreen.com|TomGreen.com]] Most famously used by [[Xenon]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7WAGYAkf98 |title=TomGreen trolled by Xenon |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-14}}</ref>.

Ironically, the "barrel roll" depicted in the game is actually an aileron roll.
