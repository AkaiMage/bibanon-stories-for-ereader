First, there are many kinds of cheese. Factors which are relevant to the categorization of cheeses include:

* Length of aging
* Texture
* Methods of making
* Fat content
* Kind of milk
* Country/Region of Origin

Fresh cheese and moldy cheese can be seen as the two main groups. Cheese is made from milk, typically from cow, goat or sheep.

You should try several diffent types to see what you like. Some of the most popular are:

* Brie
* Gorgonzola (strong taste, not for beginners)
* Camembert
* Jarlsberg
* Emmentaler (Swiss cheese)
* Blue Castello
    
In addition to these, there's an abundance of fresh cheeses with different herbs. Try what you think looks/sounds delicious.

You can consume cheese either as it is or on some sort cracker, biscuit or slice of bread. Alternatively, you could try staring at it untill it eats you!

Some cheeses are ordinarily used in dishes, such as Feta cheese (originally from the Balkan, but now mainly produced in Denmark, and made of goat and/or sheep milk). 

If you are in training, most cheeses have a very high level of fat (saturated), so eat them carefully.
