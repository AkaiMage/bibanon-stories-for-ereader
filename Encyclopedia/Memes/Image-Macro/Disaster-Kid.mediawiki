[[Image:disasterkid.jpg|thumb|Disaster Kid in context.]]
Originally a random image of a shirtless kid holding a guitar with an expression of triumph on his face and leaned back in a posture similar to that of the [[WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY]] meme. The picture was shopped into images of disasters, usually the Twin Towers and explosions. This earned him the title "Disaster Kid".
