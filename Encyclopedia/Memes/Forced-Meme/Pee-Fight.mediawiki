Pee Fight is from the Bernice Jacques III (DaxFlame) blog on [[YouTube]], produced on December 8th, 2006. The video by the same author was released February 12th, 2007 and subsequently leaked to [[4chan]]'s [[/b/]]. Instantly, the video became wildly popular on both [[YouTube]] and [[/b/]], sparking the creation of many a forced [[meme]] and thread on the subject.
