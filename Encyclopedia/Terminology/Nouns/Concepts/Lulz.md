A nominalization of the acronym LOL. Essentially laughter (usually at someone or somethingâ€™s expense). An equivalent word would be schaudenfreude.

Usually, [[Anonymous]]'s goal is to [[do it for the lulz]].

The word [[lulz]] originated when "[[DESU]]" was [[Wordfilter|wordfiltered]] to lulz. It's current meaning was defined after the FOX News report on Anonymous.
