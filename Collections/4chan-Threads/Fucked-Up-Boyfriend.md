Hello there, `/v/`.

I just wanted to let you guys know that I will soon be dating an ~8/10 nerd girl from my college who enjoys anime, video games, and the sort.

She is shy, insecure, meek, amongst other such adjectives.

I present myself as a kind, polite, well-mannered, charming, gregarious young man.

I am dating her for one sole reason: To use her to fill the holes in my heart and satisfy myself in an emotional manner.

I will not care about her in any way shape or form, besides in terms of what she can do for me. I will use her in any way I can. And because of her personality, she will accept any and all abuses I levy against her in my mission to make myself feel better about myself as a person.

She will remain eternally loyal to me because she will be convinced that any bad parts of my personality she sees don't actually exist, and I am in fact that kind, polite, well-mannered, charming, gregarious young man she first dated. There is also the fact that she will be deathly afraid of being alone, a fear I will help perpetuate at any given chance, so that she is willing to suffer even more emotional abuse from me.

At some point when I have tired of her I will throw her to the metaphorical way side, once she can no longer fulfill the requirements of what I'm using her for.

And then, once the emotional holes in my heart reform, I will find another girl like her to do this to.

How does this make you feel, `/v/`?

I think that in the end, you will regret what you've done.

It may take years, or even decades, but I am sure you will regret acting so selfishly on your deathbed.

yeah you'll regret it, not because you feel bad about it but because you'll miss her

anyway, what does this have to do with video games

You made this up because you are bored and lonely and probably fantasizing about this happening.

How does this make you feel, OP?

It's hard to incite true hatred when you explain that this all comes from the fact that you are actually a sad, incomplete person. Best of luck, I suppose. You may end up hurting this girl, but she will come out of it stronger than she was before. You, on the other hand, don't seem to have any intentions of changing your habits and attempting to better yourself.

>Get it to the point where you can just slap her in the face and she'll still worship you.

This is a point I would love to actually get her at. Can you imagine it? She would let me humiliate her endlessly but she would still love me out of her misguided emotions.

I'm getting hard just thinking about it.

This thread has made me realise that I never want to meet any of you people in real life.

I would take this woman out to dinner.

Mcdonalds, she can get anything she wants as long as it's off the dollar menu.

Whenever she starts to talk I would simply put my finger over her mouth and whisper "Hush now."

Throughout the course of the date I would be aloof and uncaring towards her, though I would tell her that her obsession with japanese culture is absurd, and that people including myself only watch her youtube videos to see her "rockin tits".

I assume this will lead to discourse about her already knowing that and how she's simply using what she's got to get views and money. I will then tell her that being an attention whoring cock tease isn't respectable, and that the second the internet gets ahold of her unclothed tits her viewership will drop by 80% at least.

This will shatter her world view. She'll stop making videos and hate me...for a day or two, until she realizes I've liberated her. She'll call me and we'll go out again. I will school her in the decorum and methods of being a non meme spouting weeaboo semi respectable girl. I will also secure many nude photographs and videos of her during our sexual escapades.

After I've had my fun I will sever all ties, and post the pictures and videos on the internet. It's my only hope that every time a /v/irgin busts a nut to one of these pictures/videos, she'll feel a pang of regret and self loathing. The icing on the cake is that every time she's reminded of these pictures and videos for the rest of her life, she'll think of me, and by proxy all the disgusting filthy porno sex we had.

When she's in her 40s, and her tits are considerably less rockin, and she's had 5 kids by some beta from /v/, she'll look me up, and when she finds me, she'll simply ask "Why?"
I'd lightly touch her cheek, and run my fingers through her hair. I'd smile, pull her closer, and whisper in her ear [spoiler]"video games".[/spoiler]

I'm not really into the physical stuff so much, but I would love to be able to emotionally abuse a girl to the point of tears and make her love me even more for it.

I would love to see a girl get on her knees and worship me like a fucking god while I treat her like dirt and garbage.

It would be fucking amazing.

Yes.

And when she does something nice, like bring you a drink or make you a sandwich, you give her a small smile that she won't see elsewhere. She thinks 'I did good' and continues to cater to your every whim. You get more displeased as time passes and she tries even harder and harder until eventually she breaks down and starts crying. You semi-console her but make her zuck ya dick while she's sad. She eventually begins to think of herself as nothing but a servant to you, her master.

I am keen observer of online behavior. I can tell just by your stilted writing style the kind of person you are in real life.

You are probably meek, introverted and lonely, polite to everyone to a fault but never willing to take the intiative. An observer, not a participant. You have an ideal girl fantasy in your head that is even more passive than you because you don't want to be the victim if you ever enter in to a relationship. The funny thing is that your politeness and stilted manner are what is preventing you from achieving any kind of success with women.

You know his personality because you too were like him, and realize that the delusions of grandeur are just a defense against the harsh reality.
