"Cool Story Bro" is the name of a famous story posted to /r9k/ on January 27, 2012, posted by an anon named Daniel (who confusingly called himself [[Uncle Anon]], but is unrelated to the original). His tripcode is `UncleAnon !!JcDj4Fv3Vfi`.

Because Dan was not skilled in the art of breaking up paragraphs or the use of periods, the story gets to be difficult to follow, excessively wordy and hard to read. 

We have broken up the text and added periods, but have edited nothing else.

## Original Run

There were two threads posted to /r9k/, `12296527` on January 27, 2012, and a continuation in `1243804` on January 28 - 29.

## Alternative Storylines

Before Dan made a tripcode, a few ghostwriters submitted troll posts to screw with their fellow anons, but some of them ended becoming interesting fanfiction in their own right.
