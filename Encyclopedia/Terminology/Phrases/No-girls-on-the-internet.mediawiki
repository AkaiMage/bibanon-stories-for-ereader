The [[Internet]]: Where men are men, women are men, and little girls are [[FBI]] agents. There are '''no girls on the Internet'''.

[[Rule 37]] of the [[Internet]]: There are no girls on the Internet.

==Origin==

On 4chan, [[anonymous posting]] is used, it is assumed that all anons are male and college-age. 

Because it has been common for males to masquerade as [[camwhores]] and girls to excite anons or improve their position, a common joke has come about that there are no (real) girls on the internet.

After many cases of false camwhores teasing anons and never providing nudes, the phrase [[TITS OR GTFO]] developed to cut out the bullshit.
