Bulk  powders are types of gunpowders consisting of nitrocellulose and a
mixture  of  other chemically explosive solutions. These nitrocellulose fibers
are  stuck together, but are not completely collided. Some contain little else
but  nitrocellulose;  others  contain,  in  addition  to  potassium and barium
nitrates,  camphor, vaseline, paraffin, lampblack, starch, dextrine, potassium
dichromate  or  other  oxidizing  or  deterrent  salts,  and diphenylamine for
stabilization, and are colored in a variety of brilliant hues by means of col-
tar  dyes. Three typical bulk powders are made up according to the approximate
formulas tabulated below:

         Nitrocellulose........................ 84.0   87.0   89.0
           % N in nitrocellulose............... 13.2   12.9   12.9
         Potassium nitrate.....................  7.5    6.0    6.0
         Barium nitrate........................  7.5    2.0    3.0
         Starch................................  -.-    -.-    1.0
         Paraffin oil..........................  -.-    4.0    -.-
         Diphenylamine.........................  1.0    1.0    1.0

The  mixture  is  mixed  in warm water and dried thoroughly. Then either
granulated  or  made  into powder by crushing with a wooden block and screened
through  a  12-mesh sieve. The material is then stored in a moisture-resistant
container for future or immediate use.
