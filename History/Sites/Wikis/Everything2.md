# Why Everything2 failed

From [Jonathan's Reference Pages](http://www.jonnydigital.com/)

Before Wikipedia took the crown as the Internet's top user-editable
encyclopaedia, there was Everything2. E2 was flush with community
features, was open to a broader variety of content than Wikipedia, and
had support of then-popular site Slashdot. What was E2, and why did
Wikipedia win?

## History

I first encountered Everything2 some time in 2000 or 2001, before most
Internet users had ever heard of Wikipedia. Websites that other people
could edit were still a relatively new concept, and aside from appointed
senior editors, users could not edit each others' writing.

This restriction may sound harsh, but it gave Everything2 a property
that Wikipedia has never had. Since users are given full responsibility
for their own writing, there's no enforced neutrality. You can find
personal anecdotes, opinion pieces, and humour, as the author wrote it,
immune to the meddling of nitpicking users. Quality control is enforced
by a communal voting system rewarding interesting, not factual content.

## Cream of the Cool

Everything2's solution to quality control was a roleplaying-game style
experience system. Users are rewarded with "experience points" for
creating content and receiving positive votes. Users received promotions
based on the number of experience points earned and writeups created,
with each level offering increasing power and responsibility.

At level 2, you gain the privilege of voting on other users, up to ten
articles per day, for which action you too are awarded experience. Level
4 grants the ability to hand out "Cools", an award that briefly promotes
the article to the front page. It's much the same model that keeps World
of Warcraft running at ten million players, and it worked to create an
average of around 45,000 writeups per year.

## So why did it fail?

Ultimately, the drawback to Everything2 was that it was naturally
subtractive. Because users couldn't edit poor quality work, a bad
writeup could only be left bad or deleted. On Wikipedia, the same
content would be gradually improved by successive users. It doesn't
matter if a user gives up and leaves, because on Wikipedia anyone else
can edit his material.

Senior E2 editors tried to combat this problem with a mass-deletion of
poor quality content, a process titled "Raising the Bar". Unfortunately,
this only discouraged users, who could return to the site after a hiatus
to discover their material removed and hard-earned experience points
deducted.

Raising the Bar improved quality overall, but did it so by oligarchy of
senior editors, rather than the democratic system already in place. The
real problem was that users weren't collaborating on content to improve
quality of the existing material, and that's something Wikipedia had
solved much better than Everything2.

## Still Good

That said, Everything2 today is still home to some great content. Here's
a list of some nodes that I enjoyed; your list can and should vary.
