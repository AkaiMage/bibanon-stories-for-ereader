At one time, 4chan's /a/ board developed a trend of threads challenging users to do cute things with their sisters and post reports. Common were "tooth-brushing" threads, where the idea was for an anon to offer to brush their imouto's teeth.

One person did so, then told the story over a period of several months, being dubbed Oral Hygiene Bro.

I have a tale for you, /a/.

A few days ago, a thread was posted suggesting /a/ brush his sister's teeth. After some consideration, I offered and eventually did brush my younger sister's teeth for her. I thought it was fun, and she didn't seem to dislike it - though she also didn't think much of my technique. That's the backstory; here's the main event.

Tonight my sister interrupted my browsing 4chan to ask about my day. Very thoughtful on her part, but not unusual. As we talked, she mentioned that she was going to get ready for bed soon. I thought nothing of it. It wasn't until she repeated that she was "going to go brush her teeth" and started slowly slinking out of the room that I picked up on what she wanted. At that point, I asked if she wanted a hand with that - and she quickly accepted. I went with her to brush her teeth again.

Tonight's session was less messy than the previous attempt since we both knew what we were doing; as before, I stood behind her and brushed from the view in the mirror. I found navigating her mouth with the brush significantly less difficult this time. While brushing, I noticed that she seemed unsure of what to do with her hands tonight. She moved them from the sink to almost touching my hands to her hips on more than one occasion.

In the end, she thanked me for brushing her teeth for her. I felt a little awkward, and I'm sure she did too. Once was just for fun, but now it felt... well, it wasn't what I might normally call intimate, but this is a lot closer than we've been since she was six or so. I'm not sorry I did it; she expressed genuine gratitude for my help. She also suggested that my brushing skill had improved. I was happy to receive her praise.

Since this chain of events was initated here, I thought I might post this in hopes that the OP of that thread see that his request did not fall on deaf ears.

I have a new story for you, /a/.

Last I posted, I had brushed my sister's teeth for the second time. Unlike the first time, the second brushing felt more deliberate and awkward. I thought that we wouldn't have a third performance. I was wrong.

While I watched television about an hour ago, she sat down beside me. Her giggles and smile told me she was having a good night. I listened as she spoke blithely about her adventures at school. At length I put my arm around her and squeezed her briefly against me, then returned to the television. Not to be ignored, she told me she wanted to switch tonight. Further inquiry on my part revealed that she wished to brush my teeth. I accepted.

Since she stands a full head shorter than myself, conventional brushing was difficult. I tried sitting down so she could brush from the front, but that didn't work, resulting in toothpaste on my shirt. She eventually procured a small step-stool and stood behind me, brushing my teeth in the mirror - as I had done hers. The feeling was... exquisite. She was incredibly gentle; she asked frequently if she was pushing too hard. After each pause for me to spit, she reengaged with renewed fervor. I was sorry for it to end. When she stepped down, she told me that I was right - that brushing someone else's teeth was fun. She was shining, and so was I.

Thank you, /a/. This was a most worthwhile endeavour you recommended.

## October 9
I have posted in the past on this topic. My sister and I have developed an occasionally problematic and somewhat needy nightly ritual because of these threads. After brushing her teeth at the behest of /a/, she decided that in addition to my brushing her teeth, she should brush mine. As of this week, we're brushing our own teeth only once a day; the nightly brushing is done by the other. The odd thing about this, though, is that I don't really want to stop it. It's both endearing and affirming that my sister and I are close - something of which I am most glad.

I'm in graduate school. She's in high school. I approached the subject with curiousity and interest - offering to brush her teeth only as a passing fancy - and while she initially declined the offer, after we talked about other subjects for a while she decided she did, in fact, want to give it a try. This has been... hmm, three weeks ago? It was only awkward after the second brushing. Before that was fun, and everything afterwards has been great. It was the second time that really made me think we wouldn't be doing it again.

## October 22
Hello again, /a/, from he who brushes his sister's teeth. I have an update to my curious tale for you.

A quick recap of events thus far: Roughly a month ago, /a/ suggested we should brush our sister's teeth for them. Intrigued by this concept, I did so. My sister and I so enjoyed the experience that not long afterward, she hinted that she wanted me to offer to brush them again - and I did so. From that point on, I have brushed her teeth every night, and she occasionally brushed mine. This odd arrangement has continued - until last night.

As was the routine, when my sister had finished her shower she requested that I brush her teeth. The thrill of the act has passed, somewhat; now I comply for the closeness that holding her softly and cleaning her teeth provides. Tonight went as previous brushings have, until the end. As I finished, I told her we were done and prepared to head back to Internet minutiae; before I could turn away, she solidly embraced me and asked to reciprocate immediately. Somewhat surprised by her hug, I acquiesced.

She took particular care that night to brush my teeth thoroughly. She would tilt my head this way and that so as to get the best angle in the mirror to view her work. I'd be lying if I said I didn't relish in her doting; her gentle and cautious brushing is truly luxurious. After at least twice again the time a normal brushing would take, she reluctantly ended my session. I thanked her, but she informed me we weren't done yet. Still standing on her footstool, she ordered me to open my mouth.

For what seemed like a long while, she looked at my teeth. I watched her eyes dart around my mouth and occasionally meet my gaze. On the stool, she stood a few inches taller than me; usually the hight difference between us is quite the opposite. Hesitantly, experimentally, she put her index finger in my mouth and pushed lightly on my back teeth. Amused by the serious face she was wearing, I responded by closing my mouth and sucking her finger. She blushed instantly and let out an audible yip, pulling her finger from my mouth. Grinning at her, I waited for her response. She looked in my eyes, looked at my mouth, and edged closer to me.

I am no fool, /a/. I understood your intent when you made that thread a month ago. I didn't care - I understood my family well enough that I was quite sure there would be no drastic changes to our relationship because of any one event. That said, my sister's charmingly rouge cheeks, uneven breath, and parted lips told me at that moment that I may have been mistakened: that she wanted to express our newfound closeness with a different sort of affection. I wouldn't say I froze - rather, I simply didn't move as she leaned forward. I closed my eyes and felt her mouth brush against my upper lip. When no further pressure followed, I opened my eyes and saw her looking guiltily away from me. I hugged her against me and told her thank you again, and then left the room.

This was yesterday evening. She has been cordial but skittish every time I see her tonight, and in about one hour she will have her shower and prepare for bed. I am curious to know if she will ask me to brush her teeth again.

I find myself hoping she does.

## October 26
Oral Hygiene Brother here, with an update.

Thanks to /a/, I am quite content to brush my sister's teeth for her, and she mine - but after what can best be described as an awkward, aborted, post-brushing kiss attempt on her part earlier, I was concerned that our toothbrushing days were numbered. However, the next night indicated that the status quo had returned again.

This update is not about recent events; our relationship currently seems stable. Rather, I'll describe events that took place on the day following my previous update.

On that night, I brushed her teeth as was usual, and again she asked to brush mine afterward. I felt a thrill at her request: this meant she was not upset about what happened earlier. After she finished, I turned around and lifted her down from the step-stool she had been using. In that moment in which our faces were close, I felt an impulse which I could not ignore. I pecked her lightly on the lips. Her bright blushing and immediate demand to know what I thought I was doing was precious. Could her brother not kiss as a show of appreciation, I reasoned? Surely there was no harm in a brief family kiss, particularly since we both now had minty fresh breath. I admitted to her that the closeness I felt with her over the past month was very valuable to me, and that I was glad to have her as my steadfast and irreplaceable sister. Warily, she admitted she felt the same about our improved rapport, and affirmed that family-style kisses - ie. no-tongue, apparently - would be okay.

Shortly before going to bed, she inquired as to why I originally wanted to brush her teeth. At a loss for words, I gave her the truth: the Internet suggested it. After considering this, she asked whether the Internet offered any other such suggestions. I declined to go into the naughtier specifics, but I gave her a few examples I remembered. She found the hair brushing suggestion particularly interesting; this has resulted in an increase in our nightly grooming time together.

Ah, yes. In short, after I had brushed her teeth, she demanded to brush mine. She spent a great deal of time on that. Afterward, she wanted to look at my teeth, and eventually put a finger in my mouth - on which I gently sucked, causing her some degree of consternation. After that, she leaned in close, and I suspected what she wanted to do. I closed my eyes and waited for soft lips to brush over my upper lip only. She must have significantly embarrassed herself, though, because she stopped. I hugged and thanked her and I wasn't sure what to make of that at the time.

## October 30
I didn't brush my sister's teeth tonight. She is feeling ill.

Despite the possibility that she has the dreaded swine flu, I have been taking care of her. If I get sick as well, then so be it; it will have been for a good cause. For most of the day I have sat with her and kept her hydrated; I also served as a nurse for any requests she might have had. She has taken medicine for her fever, and I have been monitoring her health: Tiredness, chills, fever, dizziness, and cough. For my part, I find myself distracted by her pain; at the risk of sounding cliche, I would take it upon myself if I could. I don't tell her that, of course. She has enough to cope with as it stands.

In lieu of describing a nightly brushing, I'll instead mention that serving as a nurse for my sister was not at all distasteful. Chauvinistic or not, seeing her in a weakened state reminded me how adorably cute my sister is. Of course, helping her to relax and recover was always paramount in my mind. When she felt cold, I brought her additional blankets and sat with her while she sipped hot tea. We talked of idle things when she had the strength to do so, and I let her rest when she felt tired. She expressed to me how calm she felt when I sat with her, and thanked me for "wasting" time taking care of her. Running my hand along her shoulder and arm as she lay on her side, I confided that I never considered time spent with her a waste.

She's resting now; I would not be on /a/ were it otherwise. I write these updates for /a/ because you inspired me to become closer with my sister; times such as these remind me that we were always close, however.

I have an update for you, /a/.

My sister brushed my teeth tonight. Naturally, I brushed hers as well, but the events that transpired afterward will likely perk your interest.

As you may remember, my sister was ill recently. To my relief, she has entirely recovered, and has returned to her usual, energetic self. However, she had not requested my presence for teeth cleaning activities since she fell ill. I assumed, with a heavy heart, that we would be self-brushing henceforth. Tonight proved that this would not be the case, as I happily obliged when she asked for dental assistance.

I brushed her teeth with a bit more zeal than was typical, the net result being a somewhat messier session than was strictly necessary. Once she realized my intention, though, she happily played along - her tongue playfully dodged the brush during my attempts to clean it, though it was eventually cornered and brushed. After I finished with her teeth, she took up the brush and, surprisingly, attempted to brush from the front; surprising, because we both know that means toothpaste cleanup afterward. Halfway through my session she switched to the usual from-behind position. Her body pressed against mine as she brushed.

When she finished, we cleaned up the area and ourselves. During a break in the laughter we had over tonight's toothbrushing adventure, my sister asked if I thought she was still contagious. Offhandedly, I replied that I doubted it. Later, as we hugged each other goodnight, she told me that she hoped I was right about her as she gave me a light, quick kiss. As she hugged me again, she explained it as a 'thank you' for taking care of her. When I didn't immediately respond, she laughed and claimed that I was blushing before going to her room.

It seems I was taken off-guard, tonight.

## November 7
While I am my sister's oral hygienist, my story won't focus on that topic tonight.

We continue brushing the other's teeth, though our grooming habits have spilled over into other areas as well; these days I brush her hair as well as her teeth, for example. That said, I thought I'd provide an update which is not restricted to the bathroom, so to speak.

We've grown very close these past two months; my sister and I now freely share our time with each other. Today, we had planned to do our shopping together, but that plan evolved into an outing for us both; rather than wasting the trip strictly on trivialities, we opted to first visit the ice skating rink. To illustrate the stark contrast of our improved relationship these past two months, I have never before managed to drag my sister onto the ice: while I am reasonably proficient, her experience on the ice, prior to today, comprised one ill-fated attempt roughly eight years ago. She was understandably nervous about this venture, but she was insistent that she would learn to skate today.

Naturally, her first steps on the ice were hopelessly cute. gripping the rail, she treaded the ice uneasily and spent a great deal of time steadying herself. After some coaxing, she ventured away from the wall, though she would not do so without her hand in mine. While the interior of the rink was cold, her smile, as I pulled her carefully around the ice, kept me warm. I noted with satisfaction that by the end of our session she had progressed considerably.

Due to her ankles being unaccustomed to skates, she needed to rest periodically and would watch the others and me skate while she recuperated. At one point, as I helped her back onto the ice, a well-meaning bystander with whom she had been chatting asked her if this was her first skating attempt. She replied that it sort of was, to which the woman replied that it was good that my sister had her 'boyfriend' there to help her. I arched an eyebrow when my sister did not bother to correct her.

We spent most of today together, and we spent the evening in proximity to each other. I am quite happy with this arrangement, /a/, and I suspect my sister feels the same.

## November 28

My sister and I traveled to our parent's house for Thanksgiving. We see them frequently, so this wasn't a momentous homecoming occasion. However, this holiday proved rather telling about where my relationship with my sister is heading.

On the drive to our parent's, my sister was cheerful and spirited, as usual (the energy she displays is certainly one of her more endearing qualities.) Our arrival was met with hugs from the parents and offers of victuals. Dinnertime was typical - gratuitious amounts of traditional Thanksgiving food and general updates about our lives for our parents. Eventually the topic shifted to my graduate classmates, and my mother was quick to inquire as to whether there were any future mothers of her grandchildren among them. While I mentioned the strong points of some of my female classemates, I didn't specify any as a prospective mate. This lead to a degree of good-natured teeth-gnashing due to my mother desiring that I produce offspring for her to grandmother.

During the converstaion, I noticed a shift in my sister's behavior in response to these queries; her participation in our family discourse diminished considerably, as did her appetite. Even my mother noticed that she seemed to be gingerly playing with her cranberry sauce rather than eating it. When pressed about why she wasn't particularly hungry, she claimed she was stressed from school.

She was similarly quiet during our return trip, though she did venture a disjointed question about how I felt about having kids. After a brief consideration, I replied that it depended on with whom I was having them. She didn't answer right away, but after enough time had passed that I couldn't be sure the two statements were connected, she asked simply whether I knew that she loved me. I said yes, of course. After a tense moment in the darkness, broken only by headlights and streetlamps, I added that I loved her too. I heard her exhale, but she said nothing else until we arrived at home.

I offered to let her get her shower first, but she insisted I go first. After I finished, she took her shower - which lasted for some time. She later requested that I brush her teeth, and I did so. While I'm certain this will come as a disappoinment to /a/, we do not brush each other's teeth every night anymore; it's simply not always convienent. Tonight, though, I took care of her teeth and she reciprocated. During my brushing she mentioned that she wanted to go shopping early the next day at Black Friday sales. While I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about that, I agreed to go with her. She thanked me with a kiss; though our nightly ritual seems to include a goodnight kiss if we both brush our teeth, her affection is always welcome.

I'll be taking a short break before writing the following day's segment; I prefer to write more concisely than this, and I do have someone who occasionally interrupts me...

## November 29
Hello again, /a/. Here is the continuation that I had hoped to give you yesterday.

My sister asked me to take her shopping on Black Friday. For those of you who have never experienced this glut of consumerism, it involves most large retail chains offering particularly good deals early in the morning, which means that if you want to procure these bargains, you'll be required to wait outside the stores until they open for business. Never one to say no to my sister, we woke up at three-thirty AM and set out to the stores.

The weather that morning was particularly recalcitrant, and when we arrived at our first destination the rain had changed into hail. We only had one umbrella between the two of us, so we shared it as we huddled together in line near the entrance of the store. My sister shivered in the icy wind; naturally, I couldn't stand for this, and opened my jacket before pressing her against me. I shushed her protests that someone we know might see us. It wasn't long before I felt her shivers abate and her arms wrap around me. Her head rested against my chest and neck. The calm that washed over me as I held her certainly made standing out in the damp cold more bearable.

Once we got inside the store, there was a stampede to reach the best items and then quickly reach the checkout. I made sure that we found what we needed and that my sister, due to her diminutive stature, wasn't pummeled by the crowd. We then repeated this chaotic scene at two more department stores, though we did not have to wait outside again. Once we had finished making our purchases, we began the drive home. My sister thanked me for coming with her, and admitted that she there was no way she could have come without me. I smiled and asked her to let me know the next time she needed a bodyguard.

When we returned home, the time was scarcely past eleven AM. After a lunch of leftover thanksgiving food, we sat together on the couch with the intention of watching anime; however, the early waking and bustle of shopping had left us both drained, and it wasn't long before I noticed my sister sleeping quietly beside me. I pulled a blanket over us both and shut my eyes as well.

I awoke to my sister squirming beside me. She apologized for waking me up, but her smile shined as she told me that was the best nap she'd had in ages. She then headed off to the bathroom. We spent the rest of the day oblivious to the passing of time: we watched some Bakemonogatari, we played on the Wii, and we prepared dinner as chef and sous-chef. I half expected - or perhaps hoped - after brushing her teeth again that night, that she would ask for us to sleep together on the sofa. She did not, however. For my part, I am unsure of how far our relationship can safely progress; I am unwilling - or unable - to draw any sort of line.

## November 30
Thank you for your suggestions. Well, on with the update, then, as apparently unsolicited as it may be.

Some of my classmates invited me out for drinks on Saturday. When my sister asked where I was going, I told her that I had a hot date. I hadn't expected the rush of emotions that her face showed; she seemed quite shocked, and upset as well, though her only response was, "oh." I quickly revealed that it wasn't really a date and it was just drinks with friends, but she didn't seem to think my joke was particularly amusing. She wasn't sure she believed me, either, so my advice to her was that since this event wasn't a date, she should come along and make it one. She accepted.

We arrived at the Mexican cantina, and my classmates were quick to inquire about my little lady. Most of them were greatly amused that I would bring my sister drinking with me, especially when she's not of age. I suggested she was present to soak up the culture of academia from us graduate students. A few of my classmates proceeded to quiz my sister on her grade level, her college aspirations, and her future career choices while the rest of us ordered drinks and appetizers. When the drinks came, I offered my sister a taste of the Mojito I had ordered, which she enjoyed. The rest of the evening was spent discussing work-related minutiae, hearing tales of Thanksgiving adventures, and politely discouraging one of my classmates whom I don't care for from continuing his flirtatious behavior toward, and general oogling of, my sister.

On the way home my sister asked if she looked drunk. I laughed and told her absolutely, though her three or four sips throughout the night couldn't possibly have left her buzzed. She announced that she really enjoyed our date, and she wanted to go with me again next time. As we pulled into the driveway, I told her we could go on another one sometime this week if she wanted to. Thus, we're going to a different restaurant - just the two of us - this Tuesday. Mind you, eating out together isn't particularly unusual; calling it a date, is.

One last point of interest: she didn't ask that I brush her teeth that night, but she did say I love you, in a bashful sort of way, after she bid me goodnight. I told her same to you, and I meant it. Since then, she's made it habit to remind me of that every night. Just tonight she emphasized those words with a hug from behind while I sat at my desk, a suggestion not to stay up too late, and a kiss on the cheek.

How am I to know if she's a virgin? I don't recall her having any boyfriends, but her life is her own. I spent several years during my undergraduate studies separated from her. Only recently - in the last year - have we been living together again.

## December 4
My apologies, I'm having some formatting issues. This is a rather long post.

Earlier this week, my sister and I went on our planned dinner date. We got to the restaurant late, in part due to my not expecting my sister to take as long as she did to doll herself up for the occasion. When she first came out of the bathroom with a face full of eyeliner, makeup, and lipstick, I couldn't help but laugh. She was rather cross with me until I mentioned how lucky she was that her natural cuteness didn't require her to apply makeup. She decided to wash her face and start over.

Dinner at the restaurant was almost typical for us; we've gotten used to eating out once a week or so. No matter what either of us orders we end up shopping from the others' plate, and that night was no exception. As my sister prepared a sample of her meal for me, I wondered when it was that I stopped caring if the utensils she used to separate my portion from hers had already been in her mouth. Certainly, that had been aversive to me in the past - but no longer.

She mentioned that was thinking about college, and that she wanted to go into bio-science. This surprised me, but then she told me which major she wanted to pursue: Pre-dentistry. I told her, speaking from experience, that I thought she would make an excellent dentist. The smile with which she responded was so bright made me glad I had complimented her choice.

After dinner we went for a walk in the city park. She held my hand as we walked the path around the pond. Eventually we stopped at the gazebo and watched the cold reflections in the water. During a moment of silence my sister edged close to me and asked me to warm her up, like on Friday. Without hesitation, I opened my coat and welcomed her into my arms. We stayed like that for some time, enjoying the others' warmth in the chilly night. My hands caressed her back, memorizing the form of her body through her clothes. I felt my resistance slipping - resistance to a desire long suppressed - and at that moment I decided not to deny it any longer. I separated us long enough for me and looked into her eyes - searching for any clue that what I had just resolved to do wouldn't be a terrible mistake. I saw my dear sister, whom I loved very much. Hesitating no longer, I kissed her, and it was not a brotherly kiss.

At first, she closed her eyes and accepted my lips, but as I kissed more deeply she gasped and pushed me away. Confusion and fear. My chest tightened. It was over, I thought. She despised me for what I had just done. Why shouldn't she? We had been so careful to keep our affection innocent until now. I had ruined that. Sorry, I said. I'm sorry.

My sister's breathing slowed. She stepped directly before me, her gaze steady and defiant, and asked what that was. I lamely offered that it was an end-of-the-date kiss, expecting a slap on my face. NO, I said, no, that's not what it was. The torrent of what I felt for her came out in a broken ramble. How much more enjoyable life was living together with her. How at ease I felt with her. How her energy filled the house. How much joy her smile gave me. How much I want to see her have a bright and happy future. I believe I even mentioned how attractive I found her. During a pause in my tirade, she stopped me. She took my hand and said it was okay. I tried to continue but she told me not to worry about it, and pulled me toward the car.

I turned the key in the ignition, and without looking at her asked if I should take her to our parents' house. She asked me why. Ruefully, I admitted that my impulse control was currently rather weak, and suggested that she would probably feel safer at our parents. Then I felt her arm loop through mine, and she held me tightly as she said that she has always felt safe with me. She said I never needed to apologize, and she couldn't believe all the embarrassing stuff I told her. She shushed my protests and told me to take her home. To our home.

And there you have it. The following day I brought the subject up again, and she was not afraid to discuss it. She told me she never knew how much I thought about her, though she admitted that she'd had a crush on me since before she moved in; she also took that opportunity to hint strongly that she has never had a steady boyfriend. Like so much we do together, even talking about our possible romance felt relaxed and easy. She wasn't sure how she felt about moving beyond kissing, but she was okay with - though surprised by - what happened at the park. She also said that keeping us a secret made her feel sexy. Naturally, I concurred.

After dinner this evening we watched more episodes of Chobits together. She's enjoying that series much more than Bakemonogatari; she says all the characters are adorable. At the risk of sounding banal, I find the series has a whole new life when you watch it with someone you love.

## December 9
On with the update, then.

As you know, I recently informed my sister of my love for her, and she reciprocated that love. I suppose I'd thought our lives would be different once we had expressed our feelings. Instead, daily life is largely unchanged; so much of our free time was spent with the other that romantic intimacy seems merely an extension of what we already felt. One dangerous effect of our esoteric relationship is how comfortable we've become with physical contact between us; kisses before and after I take her to school, warm embraces, and hand holding in stores would be difficult to explain to those aware of our kinship.

In contrast, our time together at home has grown increasingly affectionate. While quick, light kisses are fine for when we're out and about, we don't hold back in privacy; because of this, her previous lack of experience in kissing is quickly becoming a non-issue. Again, we've decided that it's up to her as to when we go further. That said, as of two days ago, we are sleeping in the same bed.

We continue to watch anime together, of course. We recently finished the episode of Chobits where Chii cooked a meal and wore only an apron for Hideki; while I know this is a common theme, it was the first time my sister had seen the apron-only motif. After the episode, I asked why she didn't wear an apron like that when we prepared a meal. She jokingly said she would, but it was a shame we didn't own any long aprons. I informed her that I now knew what she was getting for Christmas.

>How we came to sleep in the same bed

We had just finished an episode of anime, and she declared that it was now bedtime (we had both already showered and brushed each others teeth by this point.) She was having trouble leaving the couch, though, since my arms loitered around her waist. Giving her a gentle squeeze, I explained that I didn't want to give up my nice, cozy handwarmer yet. She reminded me that she had class in the morning. What followed was several minutes of two-way teasing, mostly regarding how I didn't have class now but she did, and how she needed to practice driving so her current chauffeur can sleep in on days like tomorrow. Eventually I relented, and wistfully helped her up.

We stood for a moment in the living room, the only light glowing from the television. My sister threw her arms around my neck and gave me a deliciously minty goodnight kiss - which was exactly what I had intended to do to her, but was a moment too slow. When we broke the kiss, I understood exactly why she held me in a light, swaying hug instead of going to bed; I wanted to stay with her, too. She asked if I was also going to bed now. I replied with an affirmative murmur. I felt her tense a little and hug me tighter. She surprised me when she asked if we should sleep in my room or hers. I suggested that my bed was a little bigger, and she nodded approval.

She retrieved her pillows from her bed and put them beside mine. Now, I usually sleep in the nude, and I suspect my sister knew this. When she reluctantly began to remove her pajamas, I proposed that since it was a cold night, we might want to sleep in our nightclothes. She smiled, then laughed and agreed, thanking me for being so considerate.

Once we were both under the covers, I was shivering, but not from the cold; my sister's warmth in my bed, the scent of her shampoo, and the sounds of her light sighs and breathing were intoxicating. I felt her hand against my chest; it probed my body until it found my arm, then sliding down to my own hand, it intertwined our fingers. Moments passed. As I lay on my back, I felt my sister moving to get comfortable. Putting my arm under her, I pulled her close to me. Both of us now being warm and relaxed, we said our goodnights and I love yous again. This would be the first time she slept on my shoulder, though it wouldn't be the last.

The following morning was certainly better than average; while I am not a morning person, waking up beside your lovely sister improves your mood considerably.

It also is worth mentioning that tonight is the first night that we haven't got to bed together since then. My sister was a little disappointed when I said I wanted to stay up and take care of a few things on the internet. She said that was okay, but that I should hurry up and come keep her warm.
