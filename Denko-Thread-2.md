##OP  
I don’t have any romantic experience, so I’m not too sure, but this girl I just started dating yesterday emailed me saying not to email her.  
And now I can’t get a hold of her. What do you think it could be? (´･ω･`)  
Was there an incident? Is she fickle? Did she have an accident? Is she testing me?  
Like I said, I’m not experienced, so please give me advice.  
  
###2ch  
(´･ω･`) Are you sure you were dating to begin with?  
  
##OP  
No, we’re definitely dating! \(´･ω･\`\)  
I’ve been in the same class as her since high school, and we went to the same college, and became friends over email.  
And just yesterday we started dating! (´･ω･`)  
I’ve never been on a date with a girl before, so I’m not sure what to think…  
  
###2ch  
First things first, shoot her some emails. About 600 should be good.  
  
###2ch  
DON’T EMAIL HER!!!  
  
###2ch  
Um, just wondering… is this “girlfriend” little more than a figment of your imagination?  
  
##OP  
Well, I confessed to her and she said “sure,” but right afterward she said not to email her.  
Even I don’t fully understand the situation… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
Going off of these other replies… yeah, you’re a stalker.  
She only unwillingly said yes because she was terrified of you.  
  
##OP  
I’VE ONLY SENT 70 EMAILS SO FAR.  
I had plans to call her yesterday, so I’m just confused… (´･ω･`)  
Maybe I should call her house?  
  
###2ch  
Getting 70 emails in a day from someday I don’t like would bring me to gross sobbing.  
  
###2ch  
ARE YOU THE 600-EMAIL GUY FROM YESTERDAY?  
  
###2ch  
Didn’t she say she was busy with work?  
Go ask her work about it.  
  
###2ch  
Somebody explain what happened yesterday, after the part where he didn’t know his brother’s contact info.  
  
###2ch  
^ OP emailed Denko a ton.  
She didn’t reply, he confessed his love.  
Right after, Denko replied “sure.”  
But it was apparently a reply from before the confession, and afterward he got an email saying “don’t email me anymore.”  
And yet, in the OP’s mind, Denko is already his girlfriend.  
  
###2ch  
Are you for real?  
If I was Denko, I’d be horrified and depressed.  
  
###2ch  
Who has the time to reply to that many emails?  
Think about her feelings, you dick.  
  
###2ch  
(´･ω･`) What is this guy even talking about?  
  
###2ch  
Denko’s crying her eyes out.  
  
##OP  
Other than being a virgin, I’m a relatively ordinary guy. (´･ω･`)  
Is there any way to force her into getting in contact with me?  
I went to her house once and talked with her mother, and she said she’d call once Denko came home.  
But I’m uneasy since it seems like she still isn’t home…  
  
###2ch  
Ordinary guys… don’t send 600 emails in three days when there’s no reply…  
  
##OP  
I’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT, OKAY.  
I realized it was a bit excessive after you all told me so… (´･ω･`)  
I’ve sent 70 emails so far, but that’s just one every ten minutes, so I think I’m good… (´･ω･`)  
  
##OP  
I’m waiting at a cafe near her house to see if she passes by, but I haven’t seen her.  
It’s in front of the station that goes to school, so she must take this route…  
  
I just want to know the truth in this unclear situation…  
I like her so much, but I feel like I’ve been betrayed… (´･ω･`)  
  
[The love letter is reposted and someone requests the previous thread be summarized, so it is.]  
  
###2ch  
This just makes me feel terrible.  
I feel so sorry for that girl.  
  
###2ch  
I don’t think she said “sure” to the confession. Who would say “sure” to that?  
  
##OP  
Come ooon, guys, stop calling me creepy!  
I know you like to joke around, but I’m heartbroken here, so I’m taking it seriously… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
You’re too self-conscious.  
Try a little harder and she’ll see your love.  
  
###2ch  
Sorry, but I wasn’t joking.  
YOU ARE A HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING CREEP.  
  
###2ch  
gOD  
  
###2ch  
That thread from yesterday…?  
Are you really the same guy?  
And what do you mean you “went on a date”?  
Tell me what “happened” there.  
  
###2ch  
So he never got his brother’s address, huh?  
If he can’t get in contact with his brother, OP is done. DONE.  
  
##OP  
I asked my mother for my brother’s phone number yesterday, but he doesn’t seem to want to talk to me.  
Talk about rude! We’re family… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
When’s your birthday, OP? She might be preparing a surprise! Consider it!  
  
##OP  
It’s March 10th… [Which was about a month ago.]  
  
What do you guys do when you fight with your girlfriends?  
I’d like to know for reference… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
Have you tried waiting in front of her house?  
Make sure to hide so no one sees you.  
  
##OP  
Of course I thought about doing that, but I decided against it, since really, isn’t that stalkery?  
So I decided to wait for her in the cafe instead… (´･ω･`)  
No matter what road she takes, she’ll pass through here, so she can’t go anywhere.  
  
###2ch  
And you think sending 600 emails in a couple days isn’t stalkery…  
  
###2ch  
Well, I’m a girl… Did you actually fight?  
Some girls will get mad and say “I’m mad! Don’t email me!”, so she might be indirectly telling you she’s mad.  
  
##OP  
I figured she might be mad…  
But, well, do girls sometimes fake being mad to see if their boyfriends really love them? (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
His brother’s a former actor, FYI.  
Assuming he’s not just making that up, I deeply pity that man…  
  
Soon enough, he’s going to have to apologize for his relative’s crimes.  
  
##OP  
I SAID I’M NOT A STALKER!  
Haven’t any of you ever waited for a girl you’re not dating?  
And a husband who waits for his wife at the station isn’t a stalker, is he?  
  
When I meet her, I think it might be best not to harshly question her or get mad, but to calmly embrace her… (´･ω･`)  
Advice, pleeease…  
  
###2ch  
ROFL  
  
###2ch  
Uh, maybe if you have mutual trust…  
But even if you’re lovers, stalking is stalking!  
If a boyfriend or girlfriend gets stalkery, the other will want to break up…  
  
###2ch  
Man! She’s totally waiting for you to come meet her!  
She doesn’t want you to email her or call her, just to come by, so forget it!  
She’s testing you for sure.  
Take up her challenge!  
  
##OP  
I guess you’re right. (´･ω･`)  
I’ll try going to her house! Thanks for the advice!  
  
##OP  
Well, actually, I’m fifty-fifty on going or not going now that I think about it… (´･ω･`)  
I’ve been sort of panicking since yesterday, so I can’t tell which is the right thing to do.  
  
If I’m really a stalker like you say, then what will happen to my relationship with Denko? I’m scared…  
  
###2ch  
Is there even a “relationship” between you?  
Or is it just a lot of her hating you?  
  
###2ch  
Ignore these dumbass trolls who say you’re not dating, or that you’re a stalker.  
That’s just the kind of tripe you get on 2chan.  
Send her another 50 emails, buddy.  
  
###2ch  
You should go!  
She’s just being shy.  
  
##OP  
Sorry I haven’t been replying much, but I’m just thinking I might miss her passing the station while I’m typing…  
  
##OP  
Okay, I made the trip! (´･ω･`)  
It looks like I’m not going to get everything cleared up unless I meet her in person.  
  
Going to ring the doorbell now…  
  
##OP  
I rang the doorbell, but nobody showed up.  
I realized it might be possible her mom was out and she was in the bath.  
And we haven’t kissed yet, so seeing her naked already would probably be rude… (´･ω･`)  
Plus I concluded that even if she came out in a bathrobe, I’d never seen a girl like that before, so I wouldn’t be able to talk well.  
So finally, I thought I’d leave a note in the mailbox.  
I bought some paper at the store and I’m thinking about what to write… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
If you’re writing a letter, you better include a bouquet with it.  
  
###2ch  
If she doesn’t want to say anything mean, then I’ll have to. Just… get away from her, now.  
Ugh. Christ.  
  
###2ch  
A long time ago, I got my girlfriend mad over a little thing, and just like the OP, she yelled at me not to contact her.  
So I went straight to her house, apologized sincerely, hugged her, and patted her head.  
After that, we had a good meal, drank at a fancy bar, and everything was just dandy.  
  
First things first, hug her and pat her head, and make sure to apologize.  
Good luck, Mr. Boyfriend!  
  
##OP  
I GOT AN EMAIL BUT I’M TOO SCARED TO OPEN IT.  
What if she says she’s breaking up with me? (´･ω･`)  
My hands are trembling at the negative things it could be…  
  
##OP  
Subject: Were you at my house?  
  
Contents:  
N/A  
  
D… Does this mean she was in the bath and couldn’t come to the door? (´･ω･`)  
Then was I wise to look into the house, but avoid the bathroom in case things went awry?  
  
###2ch  
Come on, lover boy, you’re lovers!  
Tell her you came by to see Denko’s hot bod.  
Gotta have humor in a lasting relationship, man.  
  
###2ch  
You’re hiding in your house, Denko…?  
You poor thing… I hope she has a friend to stay beside her…  
  
###2ch  
Subject: I was!  
Contents: I was worried that I couldn’t contact you, my beloved Denko.  
Since we’re dating now, I just wanted to see your face, you know?  
Well, I’m still very close by, so can we stick together today?  
  
Go with that.  
Gotta be natural inviting her on a date. Flow like water.  
  
##OP  
Thanks! My brain doesn’t work when I’m panicking like this, so that’s a big help.  
I’ll send that.  
  
##OP  
You know, I rang the doorbell a bunch of times thinking Denko wasn’t there…  
Do you think she thinks I’m rude? (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
You’re done, dude.  
  
###2ch  
Mashing the doorbell, dear god…  
This is a troll, right? Just tell me, I can’t take it.  
  
###2ch  
I’m seriously scared right now…  
  
###2ch  
- Stupid emoticon  
- Late-ass replies  
- Doesn’t know what the hell  
- Ignores actually useful replies  
- Sounds like a dumbass  
  
This guy pisses me off.  
  
###2ch  
^ SOUNDS like a dumbass?  
  
##OP  
Waiting for her reply for now. (´･ω･`)  
Romance is making for a rollercoaster of emotions…  
I’ve never had such huge shifts in feelings before.  
You’re the only real people I can talk with since I don’t have friends, but I’ve glad I have you.  
Thanks to those who are supporting me and giving advice… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
I can tell Denko’s just tsundere, man.  
Gotta embrace her to bring out that dere, OP.  
  
##OP  
I’m late saying this, but I went back to Denko’s house.  
Since I got an email, I figure she must be out of the bath by now… (´･ω･`)  
  
Well, I’ll report once we meet! Buh-bye!  
  
###2ch  
Eep…  
  
##OP  
Sorry, I needed time to figure out the situation…  
I went to Denko’s house, rang the doorbell, and Denko’s mom came out.  
And she said “If you come by again, I’ll call the police!”  
Which of these do you think it could be?  
  
A: Denko’s mother is opposed to me and Denko going out.  
B: Her mother misinterprets me as being a stalker.  
C: She’s mad about me ringing a bunch of times earlier.  
  
Those are the three possibilities I can think of… (´･ω･`)  
I’m still kind of shocked her mom’s mad at me…  
  
###2ch  
Or D: Denko has you pinned as a stalker.  
If she’s as cute as you say, she must have a boyfriend.  
You gotta embrace her as hard as you can to relieve her.  
  
###2ch  
Better email Denko to make sure.  
  
###2ch  
Don’t you already know, deep down inside?  
Little Denko’s just being shy!  
Hah, her mother must be misunderstanding why she’s red-faced in her room…  
Explain it to her and she’ll understand!  
  
###2ch  
D: Her mom isn’t misunderstanding, you ARE a stalker.  
  
Because, you know. You are.  
  
##OP  
For now, I’m calling Denko’s cellphone.  
If I don’t talk to her soon, there are only going to be more misunderstandings.  
  
If she thinks I’m weird too, I’m gonna feel terrible… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
uuuggGGGHHHH WHY DO YOU NOT REALIZE YOU WERE DONE AFTER SENDING HER 600 EMAILS????????  
  
##OP  
I can’t stop crying over how miserable I am… (´･ω･`)  
I’m crying looking into the computer screen, but still thinking about passersby giving me weird looks, which makes me cry even more…  
Love really is hard…  
  
##OP  
I think crying it all out helped.  
Thinking about it, Denko hasn’t said anything to me straight.  
So it’s her mother who’s shady… (´･ω･`)  
But if she calls the police, my life is over, so I need a way to meet Denko without involving her mom…  
  
###2ch  
Stake out behind her house.  
If Denko comes to the window, knock on it and you’re good.  
  
##OP  
I don’t want to take unnecessary risks.  
Really, waiting in front of the station is best, but I think I’ll lose if it’s a war of attrition… (´･ω･`)  
But something similarly romantic to what the guy above me said might be good…  
  
###2ch  
It’s like goddamn Romeo and Juliet, man.  
You can even throw rocks if Denko’s room is on the second floor.  
  
##OP  
Gonna go check Denko’s house! Buh-bye!  
  
###2ch  
SHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHIT  
  
###2ch  
Don’t tell me OP was arrested… was he?  
  
###2ch  
POLICE END. I knew it.  
  
###2ch  
GJ, OP! I look forward to your next work!  
  
##OP  
Back home for now. (´･ω･`)  
  
I went to her house and looked for Denko’s room.  
I saw a curtain move inside, so I peeked behind it and met eyes with Denko.  
Then she immediately screamed “MOM!!” and I instinctively fled.  
So yeah, I’m at home now… (´；ω；`)  
  
###2ch  
Damn, dude, you’re done. Give yourself up.  
  
###2ch  
Man, why did you RUN?  
  
Think about how SHE feels!  
  
##OP  
Isn’t it awful? I just don’t get it…  
Am I being played with? Why does the person most important to me have to trample on my feelings?  
I know that all her feelings must have turned to hate now…  
She’s really getting upset with me… (´･ω･`)  
I punched a wall really hard and now my hand hurts too… This is the worst…  
  
###2ch  
If it were me, I’d go back and make sure to talk with her. Or better yet, give her a letter written in my own blood.  
Write in your own blood and she’ll know it’s true.  
  
###2ch  
^ Now THAT’s romantic.  
  
##OP  
Contents:  
Don’t call me or email me anymore, please.  
I’m sorry, but I’m really, really scared.  
If there’s been a misunderstanding, then I apologize.  
But this is my last email. Please don’t contact me again, I’m begging you.  
  
What does this mean…? (´･ω･`)  
I’ve been thinking about it for a good while now and I’m just not sure…  
  
###2ch  
It means “DON’T CONTACT ME EVER AGAIN FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.”  
  
###2ch  
Her mother is a wicked woman.  
Don’t be fooled, OP.  
  
###2ch  
You’re still only banned from phone calls and emails.  
Do you have a carrier pigeon?  
  
###2ch  
> Don’t call me or email me anymore, please.  

In short, don’t associate with her.  
  
> I’m sorry, but I’m really, really scared.  

She’s afraid of the things you’re doing.  
  
> If there’s been a misunderstanding, then I apologize.  

You apparently think Denko likes you, OP, but she doesn’t like you at all.  
  
###2ch  
You’re being tested, OP.  
  
Are you really going to give up here?  
  
Is this truly the extent of your love?  
  
###2ch  
OP’s love is so pure, I don’t think I could possibly imitate it.  
  
###2ch  
I’m guessing this is what the OP thinks:  
  
> Don’t call me or email me anymore, please.  

She wants to meet me in person! (´･ω･`)  

> I’m sorry, but I’m really, really scared.  

Denko must be in danger… I’ve got to help her! (´･ω･`)  

> If there’s been a misunderstanding, then I apologize.  

We’ve repaired our friendship. Now we’ll always be together! (´･ω･`)  

> But this is my last email. Please don’t contact me again, I’m begging you.  

Yep, definitely wants to meet in person! (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
^ Terrifyingly… accurate…  
  
##OP  
My mind is a blank.  
What does Denko want to become of our relationship?  
I want to meet her face to face, but…  
Oh, and my power cut out again… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
So, this is a troll, right?  
If not, then go turn yourself in to the police, OP.  
  
###2ch  
This has taught me a lot about the mentality of a stalker.  
  
##OP  
I AM SO AFRAID OF DENKO REJECTING ME. (´･ω･`)  
At this point, I’m not sure if it’s possible to get the happy end that everyone wants…  
  
I’m trying to think of an email to send Denko, but my mind’s been a blank.  
  
###2ch  
Don’t send anything.  
  
If you see her at school, tell her you’re really sorry for troubling her! Okay?!  
  
###2ch  
What everyone wants is Denko’s safety.  
Just leave Denko alone.  
She must be so confused…  
  
###2ch  
That… everyone… wants…  
  
###2ch  
Uh. What everyone wants is OP BEHIND BARS!!  
  
###2ch  
"The happy end that everyone wants"…? What planet does this kid live on?  
  
##OP  
All you guys hating me is getting annoying…  
I’m afraid I might be brainwashed by this place… (´･ω･`)  
I’m going to ignore 2ch’s opinions and write an email with my heartfelt feelings!  
  
###2ch  
If you like Denko, then don’t send it. I’m serious.  
  
Stop giving her reasons to despise you!  
  
###2ch  
And he doesn’t even know why he was bullied in school.  
  
##OP  
Subject: This Is How I Feel  
  
Contents:  
I’m sorry for making you worry.  
I would never consider killing or raping you, Denko, so don’t worry. Is that what you thought I would do?  
Now, I want you to take what I’m saying seriously.  
I really, truly love you, Denko.  
I think I would be willing to die for you, Denko.  
I’ve always been trying to ensure your happiness first.  
And I don’t think my feelings for you will ever change.  
It’s very unfortunate things got like this right after we started dating, but we can start over.  
That would be great, wouldn’t it?  
Remember what I said when I confessed to you?  
I still feel the way I did back then…  
  
Well, I sent this. (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
PERFECTION.  
  
###2ch  
Oh christ, that first part will give me nightmares.  
Even if this is just a troll, it’s horrifying that you can even THINK of that!  
  
###2ch  
Speaking as a girl, I would absolutely call the police if I got this.  
  
##OP  
If there’s any further developments, I’ll make another thread.  
Still waiting for Denko to reply now. (´･ω･`)  
Thanks for everyone who’s given support!  
Keep watching over us as we work toward happiness!!  
Thank you! I’m so grateful!
