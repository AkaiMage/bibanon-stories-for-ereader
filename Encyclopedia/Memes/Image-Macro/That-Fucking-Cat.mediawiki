[[Image:thatfuckingcat.jpg|thumb|If I see that fucking cat one more time...]]'''Cover-Tom''' is a [[forced meme]] showing Tom from the "Tom and Jerry" cartoons (specifically the shitty Chuck Jones version) with a smirk. Oft accompanied by an allegedly witty phrase, or "'''I see what you did there'''." Cover-Tom was also the [[4chan GET Encyclopedia#9 Million|9.2M post]] on [[/b/]], as well as the 9.3M post, albeit in his "Lite Brite pieces" appearance.

Cover-Tom is notable for becoming one of the very few forced memes to graduate to full meme status.

=== THAT FUCKING CAT ===
'''Cover-Tom''' inspired the phrase "'''IF I SEE THAT FUCKING CAT ONE MORE TIME...'''" after Tom had been floodposted to [[/b/]] for what seemed like days, and the practice of posting a picture of corrupt US Congressman '''Tom DeLay''', with a similar look on his face ([[delayclose.jpg]]), in response/competition.
