[420chan](http://www.420chan.org) is an imageboard based primarily on recreation drug use, however it also has boards related to academia, humor, and pornography. It was the center of the [[Hal Turner]] raids and has had one of the greatest [[/i/]]nsurgency boards anon has ever seen, however Kirtaner has recently said /i/ will never return to 420chan. 

### History

Originally there was a site called 420chan.net, but Kirtaner made 420chan.org as a joke, and in response to the 420chan.net guy whining about it, he made it 420chan.org a real imageboard. It was better, and soon surpassed 420chan.net.

Then for a LONG ASS TIME 420chan went down because someone posted that virgin killers album that has an underage chick on it (from Wikipedia?) and their host kicked them offline for [[CP]]. Luckily 420chan was back in time for /b/day.

### According to Kirtaner
> Well one day I was sitting around and I noticed that my new hosting package allowed for a single free domain name registration. I was talking to some friends and one of them came up with "420chan", a stupid combination of my penis and drugs. I decide to use this suggestion, and register it as a joke domain many many moons ago. Since then a lot of people bitched at me to do something with the domain, so I did. And you're looking at it.

### Current State

There are two types of people who go on 420chan: druggies and antisocial intellectuals.  To sum up all the boards into 3 categories, there are 13 boards dedicated for every fucking drug that exists, some for intellectual bullshit like science and math, and the porn sections, which no one ever goes on.
