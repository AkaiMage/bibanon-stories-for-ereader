## Board titles

*Needs to be merged with the [[4chan History Timeline]].*

I didn't keep track of the order in which 4chan boards were launched. The following list is collected mainly from 4chan news posts and web
archives.

-   **30th September, 2003:** Moot announces 4chan.net in Something Awful's ADTRW forum. Thread is titled "4chan.net - English
    2chan.net!"
-   **2nd October 2003:** 4chan's /b/ is already in place, according to a news post on a complaint. It is named after 2chan's /b/ board, and
    according to [Everything Shii Knows](http://shii.org/knows/4chan) was originally the only 4chan board. The rules page describes /b/ as
    a test board which will later become an anime board. moot describes /b/ in a news post as "a retard bin". 4chan's "/h/ - Hentai" board
    launched.
-   **6th October 2003:** "/c/ - Anime/Cute" added as a place to post "cute anime/hentai pictures". "/d/ - Hentai/Alternative" added as a
    /h/ spinofff "to appease all those who thought the restrictions on /h/ were too Nazi-ish." "/y/ - Yaoi" and 4chan Oekaki BBS drawing
    board added.
-   **8th October 2003:** 4chan's /b/ board is currently named "/b/- Anime/Random", although I can't remember if it had an earlier name.
    Archived thread reveals that the "/w/" board (wallpapers) existed by this date.
-   **9th October 2003:** "/g/ - Guro" added to clean the most nasty images out of /h/. "/s/ - Sexy Beautiful Women" added, and is
    managed by Boco\_T and PotatoSan. Boco\_T also drew two of 4chan's title images: one of Osaka from Azumanga Daioh, and one of
    Cardcaptor Sakura drawn in the style of Fist of the North Star.
-   **8th November 2003:** "/a/ - Anime" launched. "/l/ - Lolikon" launched to clean up /c/.
-   **22nd November 2003:** Some time between 16th October and 22nd November, /b/ has been re-named to "Random", perhaps as there is now
    a dedicated anime board. A news announcement reveals that a board named "/r/ - TRAINZ" was running, but has been moved to 1chan
    (trains trains trains).
-   **28th November 2003:** News announces that "/l/" has been removed.
-   **8th January 2004:** "/l/" returns. Newspost reveals that "/r/" (Request) has been created to solve a problem with "/t/" (Torrents),
    which evidently had already existed for a while.
-   **25th January 2004:** "/t/" removed.
-   **19th February 2004:** "/f/ - Flash" added. "/t/ - Torrents"
    returns.
-   **21st February 2004:** Two discussion boards added: "/amh/ - Anime-Manga-Hentai", and "/bbs/ - 4chan Discussion".
-   **28th March 2004:** An old saved-out thread reveals that "/p/ - Photo" and "/u/" existed by this date. Top of page boards list:
    a/b/c/d/f/h/l/p/r/s/t/u/w/y.

    was created to keep male content out of /c/. The discussion boards "/anime"/, "/ascii/" and "/game/" already existed. /r/ was named

-   **1st January 2010:** The following boards are listed on the rules page, and must have been created before 2010: "/an/ - Animals & Nature", "/cgl/ - Cosplay & EGL", "/co/ - Comics & Cartoons", "/m/ - Mecha", "/po/ - Papercraft & Origami", "/tg/ - Traditional Games, "/tv/ - Television & Film", and "/x/ - Paranormal". There is an upload board, "/rs/ - Rapidshares". Several discussion boards have been created and shut down over the site's run.

There is a Science & Math text board.
-   **18th January 2011:** /r9k/ and /new/ removed. The current board list is: 

	[a / b / c / d / e / f / g / gif / h / hr / k / m / o / p /
	r / s / t / u / v / w / wg] [i / ic] [cm / y] [3 / adv / an / cgl /
	ck / co / fa / fit / int / jp / lit / mu / n / po / sci / soc / sp /
	tg / toy / trv / tv / vp / x] [rs] [status / ? / @]

### Boards sharing a letter

Several boards have used the same letter as another board at a different
point in time. Usually, this occurs when a single-letter board is
deleted and its letter is later re-used.

-   /g/ - Guro, Technology
-   /n/ - Trains, Nature & Wildlife, News, Transportation
-   /p/ - Photo, Photography
-   /x/ - General Photo, Paranormal

### Secret boards

There were two secret boards I knew of. The first was /5/, which was for
posting pictures of 5. The second was /z/, an exile board detailed at
[Everything Shii Knows](http://shii.org/knows/4chan).
