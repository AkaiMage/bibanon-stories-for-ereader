== Meme ==
"All your base belong to us" was a line in the opening scene of the almost completely unknown arcade game called "Zero Wing" made by the extinct Japanese gaming company, Toplan. The reason it was in such poor grammar was because it was being translated from Japanese to English in a hurrry, people say they did the translation over night. The game was ported to the Sega Genisis right before Toplan tanks. Many people notice the bag grammar and made many wacky things for it including a song and thousands among thousands of pictures. People say the fad is long dead but they also said that about Keith Richards. A lot of the pictures including the phrase had a kitten saying it not because it's cute but because the character who said the line was named Cats, but yet had no relation to cats in his character.

Here is the conversation in the cut scene:

 In A.D. 2101
 War was beginning.
 Captain: What happen?
 Mechanic: Somebody set up us the bomb.
 Operator: We get signal.
 Captain: What !
 Operator: Main screen turn on.
 Captain: It's You !!
 Cats: How are you gentlemen !!
 Cats: All your base are belong to us.
 Cats: You are on the way to destruction.
 Captain: What you say !!
 Cats: You have no chance to survive make your time.
 Cats: HA HA HA HA ....
 Captain: Take off every 'zig' !!
 Captain: You know what you doing. 
 Captain: Move 'zig'. 
 Captain: For great justice.
