Wawa-chan was a camgirl who first appeared on [[4chan]]'s Sexy Beautiful Women board on March 19, 2007

== General ==
* Alias: Wawa-chan
* Name: Tiffany
* DOB: 1987

== History ==
Wawa-chan lives in New Jersey with a flaming roommate, and has a penchant for Wawa stores (hence her Chan name). She is a femme lesbian and a geek.

Update: I no longer live there and actually in reference to the statement about camwhores not getting enough attention, I stopped camwhoring because I got married and had kids. I still get plenty of attention. :)

=== Likes ===
Volunteering for the Special Olympics, myself, collecting pins, my mommy, taking pictures, posting on the CHAN sites, and being madly in love with my ex-girlfriend.
* Music: Mindless Self Indulgence, Three Days Grace, Disturbed, Panic! at the Disco, Fall Out Boy, and My Chemical Romance.
* TV: The L Word, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, Monk, and Law & Order:Special Victims Unit.
* Movies: Pulp Fiction, A Clockwork Orange, and the Cube trilogy.

=== Dislikes ===
Immaturity, homophobes, the smell of cigarettes, George W. Bush, the sound you make when you chew, and being apart of a fad.
