[[Bel-Air]] refers to the posting of the themesong from the popular 90's sitcom "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air". In mid-2006, posters began countering extremely long copypasta with a "Bel-Aired" version, in which, halfway through the copypasta, the text was replaced with the following lyrics from the opening credits of the show.

: ''... my mom got scared and said ''
: ''"You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air." ''
: ''I whistled for a cab and when it came near, ''
: ''the license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror. ''
: ''If anything I could say that this cab was rare ''
: ''but I thought "Nah, forget it, Yo homes, to Bel-Air!" ''
: ''I pulled up to the house about seven or eight ''
: ''and I yelled to the cabby, "Yo homes, smell ya later!"'' 
: ''I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there,'' 
: ''to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.''

The Bel-Air theme has since been used for a variety of purposes, including modifying the lyrics to ridicule people or glorify anonymous, as its own copypasta, and more.
