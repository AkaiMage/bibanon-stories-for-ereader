**Tasha's Brother** was a wincest greentext-turned-actual-story about...wincest! Also, a few other things. But there really is a remarkable amount of wincest.

The story, posted on /b/ between February 2013 and February 2014, details the author's relationship with both his sister, Tasha, and his sister's friend, Amanda, and his attempts to move out and become less dependent on his parents. Oh, and Tasha gets seriously injured at least twice. And there's quite a lot of sex.

However, it's an excellent read, and well written. /b/ waited with bated breath and one hand on keyboard for each installment, going so far as to nominate the author, known only as Anon in the story (smart of him), as "/b/ author of the year", until [[Lily|The Liliad]] came along and basically demolished this story's chance of winning the /b/ulitzer prize.

OP posted more every two weeks or so, which was then typeset into a PDF file and posted to a [Jumpshare](https://jumpshare.com/v/46jrYryVmDXbEkcKv3Mb). After taking a break from August to October, OP began updating again, revealed that his name was Peter, and rewrote the first, greentexted entry.

Note: As not all the updates are on Bibanon, please use the Jumpshare until all updates are filled.
