On August 30th, 2014, an anonymous leaker decided it was a good idea to post one of his rarest clandestine "treasures" to the world; nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, and other major American Celebrities. The forum for it would have to be anonymous, public, and popular; 4chan's /b/. Shitstorms ensued.

Needless to say, leaks of any sort involving the antics of celebrities are instant newsmakers (as those *disgusting celeb paparazzi magazines* at the supermarket checkout line will drill into you). The machines of yellow journalism were quick to finger the blame upon 4chan itself, and attempted; yet again, to make sense of the dark corners of the internet (in the vein of Fox News's "Hackers on Steroids").

### Negative Effects on 4chan

The incident launched massive hordes of immigration into 4chan by paparazzis, SJWs, alleged JLaw advisors, and (unsurprisingly) looky-loo fappers. 

The massive traffic increase and constant spam was unmatched by any previous crisis, and brought 4chan to it's knees. Anons attempted to mount a desperate defense against the hordes, spamming horrific gore pics in a war of attrition to keep the looky-loos out. The shitstorm was a night that they would never forget.

The leak unleashed a grievous scandal, public outcry against 4chan itself (though luckily for anons, the media and JLaw failed to understand [whether 4chan was a person or website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz5i171h_no)), and a new wave of immigrants who were determined to bring 4chan's /b/ right back into a strange new age of cultural importance on the internet.

## Timeline

### How the hell did the leaker get this stuff?

There is a massive underground movement where users trade supposed nude photos of celebrities, and pay tons of money for the privilege. When you're talking about photos worth millions of dollars; well, it's a huge incentive for a hacker or two to make some easy money. Just like illegally obtained fine art, most users jealously guard their loot, and will never share it with anybody; knowing full well the bombshell scandal that will unfold if it does get out.

[Here's a good GQ Article on the topic.](http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201205/chris-chaney-hacker-nude-photos-scarlett-johansson)

The actual leak itself is inferred to be a breach in Apple's iCloud service; since that's where JLaw uploaded it. (Well, at least we understand the absurdity of the cloud.)

But for some reason, one plucky anon just wanted to see the world burn. I could think of far better uses of that million dollars (probably paid in Bitcoins); but the world may never know.

## Reactions

### What did the Internet do in response?

Jennifer Lawrence was not pleased to hear about the incident, and broke down in the strain. True; she is a celebrity in the public eye, and no one is able to control the thoughts of her onlookers; but come on, who deserves to be lumped in with the likes of Britney Spears or Lindsay Lohan?

Many users decided to campaign to fund her favorite charity (The Pediatric Cancer Foundation) to make amends for the terrible shitstorm.

### What did 4chan do in Response?

* [4chan #leakforjlaw prank](http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/4chan-leakforjlaw-prank/) - 4chan's /b/, overwhelmed by the horde of newfags, gives up and decides to go for the lulz by inciting Twitter SJWs to "leak their pics" in "solidarity" with JLaw.
* [Change.org petition to Moot to "Shut down 4chan"](http://www.change.org/p/christopher-poole-shut-down-b-on-4chan-org) - A petition crops up for people to demand that 4chan be shut down due to this incident. However, in light of the fact that nobody listens to internet petitions, some anons may have attempted to  further the lulz by posting fake signatures from “Sir Barnacle Encrusted flopsacock “ and “chris chan”. 

### What is going to happen to the Leaker?

[The Feds have been mobilized](http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/fbi-addressing-massive-celebrity-photo-hack/story?id=25200140) to track down the leaker (extorting the IP from 4chan, probably), and is poised to use him as an informant to discover this secret nude-sharing ring. Let's hope this leaker used seven proxies.

The leaker will probably get 10 years in prison maximum, [as previous prosecutions for leaks seem to imply.](http://www.wired.com/2011/10/nude-celeb-hacker-arrested/)

What a disproportionate use of force, to "defend" the reputation of American Celebrities. Though I guess the incident does count as an Attack on American Culture; in the literal sense.

### How will this incident affect the world at large in the near future?
