'''Cracky''' is a popular [[4chan]] [[meme]] featuring a disturbed little girl with black cat ears and badly applied makeup. So popular were the pics that the 4chan team set a [[wordfilter]] to change "[[cracky]]" when it appeared on the boards to other random words ending in -cky automatically. In the past when someone used 'cracky' in a post, it got changed to Jacky, Packy, Condracky or something similar.

It was reported that Cracky-chan killed herself. However, this was most likely just a rumour started by Cracky-chan to get [[/b/]] to lay off her, or mindless trolling. On May 12th 2005 at around 9:30 central time US, someone using the name "Trotsky Was a Jew" began posting new pictures of a girl he believed to be Cracky-chan on /b/. The photos came from a livejournal, the url of which was revealed a little later in the same thread.

Later that same day, the mods (or a mod) began deleting any and all threads containing the new pictures. People who re-posted the pictures were summarily banned, although the bans seem to have been temporary for at least some. Anonymous speculated that the reason for the bans was that some of the pictures were semi-nudes, and the mods were weary of child pornography being posted.  An Anonymous-mod later revealed however that Cracky-chan had asked them to remove any pictures of her from the site, and request new ones not to be posted. According to Squeeks, [[W.T. Snacks]] is the reason why cracky images were banned on 4chan. When /b/ started posting nudes of her, snacks contacted her, and he offered to remove them. Over time the unofficial rules of posting pics and mentioning the word 'cracky' have been lifted.

Part of the reason for the longevity of the Cracky-chan meme is that she took many well composed artistic photos, often self portraits, and uploaded them to various online communities such as LiveJournal. These were inevitably found/shared by her fans, allegedly sometimes through dubious means such as password hacking, leading to a steady drip of  cracky content. Finding this content and more about cracky therefore became a sort of competitive game amongst particularly obsessed cracky fans, and some trolling was conducted via the posting of fake clues.

From July 2005 to July 2006, a compiled collection of Cracky pictures and fan art appeared at a website called Crackypedia, run by a [[4chan]] [[/b/]] tripfag known as Warchief Rend Niggerhand. The website closed on July 6th 2006, with the author posting a macro, the date of closure, the final number of hits, 17464, and the message, "Hope you enjoyed it folks, I told you it wouldn't last forever."

On February 13, 2006, a person widely believed to be Cracky posted to the /cracky board on 420chan, asking for all her "stalkers" to leave her alone. /cracky had reached what might be considered disturbingly stalkerish levels in its short life, with threads on such topics as trying to find her house in google earth and tracking her down through online communities/deviantart etc. She updated her old "scarecrowmaiden" deadjournal to provide proof.

Her identity as the real Cracky-chan was supported by the journal update, independent confirmation by Kirtaner of such things as originating IP and a new photo of her holding up a sign, asking for /cracky to be closed. It is the last photo from cracky to the chan community. The photo however is considered to be the last photo from cracky herself requesting closure to the chan community.

== Cracky's Location ==
From [http://wtfux.org/cams/kareha.pl/1124905651/ this long dead WTFux thread]: "oh shit nobody mention she lives in Oxford near a football pitch and a church because there are so few churches and football pitches in the UK, also nobody mention she sometimes skates at the Oxford Ice Rink because I am sure she will be there exactly when tirel shows up with the <s>flowers+engagementring</s> ether+duct tape"

Due to information leaks that came about, such as the one above, pictures from Google Maps were uploaded stating that they are her location.

=== Cracky's so fucking cute and sweet. ===
[[Image:How To Kill A Cracky.jpg|250px|left]][[Image:Cracky Found.jpg|250px|right]]
Cracky's so fucking cute and sweet. I'd treat her to some fancy restaurant, than take a long romantic walk with her, holding hands and talking about philosophy, art and dreams. Then I'd invite her to my home and ravage her hot ass for hours, and forcing my cock up her throat so she chocked on both the throbbing cock and her own rectal juice. I'd then proceed to cum on her cute innocent face. Then. as the ultimate love gift, I'd carry her in my arms to the tub and let my piss wash away the semen and last dignity from her. I'd wisper "I love you" and give her a tender smile, and cut her throat from ear to ear with a knife. Covered in her own warm blood, she'd look straight into my very soul, forgiving, understanding. A bubble from blood and saliva would burst between her lips, then she'd die. After some additional lovemaking, I'd stuff her into a bin bag. Three weeks later, some playing children will find her mutilated and desecrated body in the forest. 

They will be scarred for life.

=== Thank you 4chan ===

Thank you 4chan. 

Today morning my parents had a call. The girl you know as "Cracky-chan' wanted to kill herself and is in hospital now. She will die in one or two days. 

FUCK YOU ALL for this I knew her FOR REAL over years. I was never so sad in my life before. Guys do you not realise that this is for real? Thats not fun in the realtity a REAL person DIE because of 4chan. 

I hope so all 4chan assholes burn in hell for ever. Thank you 4chan for killing one of my friends. I think this will bring consequences to 4chan. 

This is my wish.

=== Cracky is a psychic parasite on the human race. ===
Cracky is a psychic parasite on the human race. She feeds off of our minds. Do you remember life before Cracky? It is harder and harder to hold on to shit. Sometimes I think one day I will wake up and there will be nothing left of me. My dreams, hopes, fears, memories, everything that is me, will be gone, eaten up to speed her growth. It's like she is a memetic caterpillar eating everything in it's path and devouring her own world as she does so. Gorging herself on the collective unconscious, inching across it like a leaf. We each become part of her and willing or not she uses our interaction to pull more of us into her. Soon she will have made enough of us her that she can survive metamorphosis. She will hide herself while she build the form she will need to spread to other sentients. The world will forget her, but she will be there shapely legs and all. In every ugly act we commit against each other, every casual cruelty and petty violence. Growing in that fertile womb of negativity, she will change. I pray for the day she emerges from her cocoon. When she does leave the human mind will be surplus to her needs and so she will release us. I fear after holding us so long, without her influence holding us together society will collapse and we will die out. Alone, unmourned, and unloved. 

I have an erection.

=== At one point I had a wine cellar. ===
At one point I had a wine cellar. 

Well, to be fair it was a wine basement. 

OK... a small, otherwise disused wine closet in a basement... but I digress... 

Five times every two months I would go down to it and turn the bottles, having no more response from the cheaper ones than the cold glass against my skin. On the more expensive ones I remember watching the grape silt upended in the bottle like a viticultural snow globe. It was beautiful. I'd have done it even if I never planned to taste the wine. 

Cracky pics are like that. I've seen them all before... I could probably sketch them freehand. That isn't the point. The point is giving them that bit of attention every few weeks... appreciating her while respecting the fact that she is ever on the other side of the glass. 

I could no more enjoy looking at them offline from a folder than I could enjoy turning the bottles in a supermarket. It just isn't the same as lurking about in the damp darkness of the 4chan wine cellar. 

I honestly don't expect you to understand.

I AM GOING MAD I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE. IF I EVER SEE SOMEONE MENTION 4CHAN IN REAL LIFE I'LL FUCKING BEAT HIM TO DEATH WITH MY BELT; EVENTUALLY, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO KILL ALL THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS

It's H5180. Don't you get it? 

http://www.promochoice.co.uk/acatalog/RW_H5180_Printed_T-Shirt_215_gsm.html 

That Hanes shirt is typically labeled as H5180 in the UK. In the mirror it is backwards, or opposite. She has no shirt on, opposite of what is intended with that shirt. She is not a man, which the shirt is intended for, opposite. She is not beefy, which that shirt was intended for, opposite. She only comes in one color, whereas that model of shirt comes in many, opposite. That shirt is a thing, and she is portraying herself as a human being with emotions, which the raw feel of the picture is indicative of. This picture is beautifully orchestrated to symbolize opposites. Like yin/yang. She is an invariably talented artist who is very cryptic

=== The mind of Cracky is utterly inhumane in its depth and complexity. ===
The mind of Cracky is utterly inhumane in its depth and complexity. Without mercy or moral feeling Her consciousness stands upon the edge of spiritual destruction. That She does not fall must be the result of constraints and balances which only a god could understand. To a mere human it is yet another reminder that we are but children compared to that ancient and powerful being.
