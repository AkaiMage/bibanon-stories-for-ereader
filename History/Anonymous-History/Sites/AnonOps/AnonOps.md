AnonOps was the premier IRC network for Anonymous during Operation Payback. It's history has not been well recorded, but as it is highly important to Anonymous and quite interesting in itself (raids, secret societies, coups and V&s).

Hopefully, a AnonOps user/operator could update this and make it better.
