Also, "itty bitty baby, itty bitty boat" and "twinkie house". An attempt at a [[meme]] by photoshopping nonsense words into the speech bubbles on the page of a father/son incest comic; a good portion of [[/b/]] ran with it, and anyone posting a comment that contains the words "I don't believe it" will likely get a few "Habeeb it!" replies. A few people are using "Habeeb it" instead of "believe it" in normal speech as well. Several attempts to cross-pollinate this with other [[meme]]s have been made, though none of them have really caught on. Also frequently shows up in Naruto threads in [[/a/]], as the main character's catchphrase is "Believe it!"
