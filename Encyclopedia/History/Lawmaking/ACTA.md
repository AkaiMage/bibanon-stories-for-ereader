# Intro #

**The Muyo this is Chrisblood and I'm asking you work with us not against us The reason being is that we are stronger as a group not individuals.**
Every time you reefer to us a trolls you are only hurting yourself the reason being is because to do not listen.  Our ideas could change the whole concept of raids plus your ideas of raids in masks don't help
To be anonymous you must remain anonymous...  and the best way would be to blend into the public not be noticed as fags.
We don't need another Project chanology that didn't achieve anything apart from lulz.****

## IRL ##

No raids ,at least without proper planning and if a raid is a must then no masks if you're wondering why then I suggest you are a fucking idiot.
This raid doesn't need the masks what is needs is normal people backing us so in order for that to happen no masks shall be taking place.

## Details ##

On November 3 2009, a war started. A war so possibly huge that it may destroy the whole Internet it self.
ACTA was announced. The ACTA (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement) is the first step towards Internet censorship. here is a brief summary of the act
That ISPs have to proactively police copyright on user-contributed material. This means that it will be impossible to run a service like Flickr or JewTube or Blogger, since hiring enough lawyers to ensure that the mountain of material uploaded every second isn't infringing will exceed any hope of profitability. 
That ISPs have to cut off the Internet access of accused copyright infringes or face liability. This means that your entire family could be denied to the Internet -- and hence to civic participation, health information, education, communications, and their means of earning a living -- if one member is accused of copyright infringement, without access to a trial or counsel. 
That the whole world must adopt US-style "notice-and-takedown" rules that require ISPs to remove any material that is accused -- again, without evidence or trial -- of infringing copyright. This has proved a disaster in the US and other countries, where it provides an easy means of censoring material, just by accusing it of infringing copyright. 
Currently these Countries are in the ACTA Program :
"Participants in the first round of negotiations (June 2008) included Australia, Canada, EU, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the United States."

## Getting the word out ##

Copypastas (Ways to inform the masses)
My fellow anons
The time has come.
The time has come to stand up and fight for what we believe in.
TLDR: READ IT FGT
A treaty known as the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement is being discussed in secrecy in closed boardrooms by 
Politicians and Private Corporations, as well as Organisations such as the MPAA and RIAA.
This treaty will essentially give them the power 
To Censor any Website deemed "inappropriate"
To subjugate you to random searches of Laptops and iPods without warrants
To fuck with your Privacy by making ISPs monitor you and making them responsible for you.
For those of you who cannot understand the Implications of this,
it means your freedom has been traded for Cold hard cash to Media conglomerates
Three years ago, a great multitude of our brothers stood up to Scientology, because it has been decided that
Anonymous will not stand for Censorship,
Anonymous will not stand for Oppression of the Internet,
Anonymous will not stand for Anyone who dares to fuck with the Internet.
It is now our time to stand up for ourselves.
To show these fucking Politicians NOT TO FUCKING SCREW WITH OUR INTERNETS AND OUR /b/.
Because for every Anon that falls in battle, 10 must take his place.
Join us at the IRC
<http://www.occultusterra.com>
Gentlemen, please be seated as we wait upon the words of a great man. 
Men, this stuff that some sources sling around about Anonymous wanting out of this war, not wanting to fight, is a crock of bullshit. Anonymous loves to fight, unfairly. All real Anonymous love the sting and clash of battle. You are here today for three reasons. First, because you are here to defend your net neutraility and your downloads. Second, you are here for your own self respect, because you would not want to be anywhere else. Third, you are here because you are real men and all real men like to fight. When you, here, everyone of you, were kids, you all admired the champion oldfag, the fastest cracker, the toughest toughguy, the big league troll players, and the All-Anonymous raiders. Anonymous loves a winrar. Anonymous will not tolerate your fail. Anonymous despises cowards. Anonymous plays to win all of the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who laughed and lost. That's why Anonymous has never lost nor will ever lose a war; for the very idea of failure is hateful to Anonymous. You are not all going to V&, only point two percent of you right here today would be V& in a major battle. To be V& must not be feared. Death, in time, comes to all men. Yes, every newfag is scared in his first raid. If he says he's not, he's a liar. Some men are cowards but they fight the same as the brave men or they get the hell slammed out of them watching oldfags fight who are just as scared as they are. The real hero is the anon who fights and even if he does afraid. Some anons get over their fright in a minute under fire. For some, it takes an hour. For some, it takes days. But a real man will never let his fear of being V& overpower his honor, his sense of duty to his internets, and his innate neckbeard. Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base. Anonymous pride themselves on being He Men and they ARE He Men. Remember that the ACTA is just as frightened as you are, and probably more so. They are not supermen. All through your Anonymous trollings, you men have bitched about what you call "white knight faggotry". That, like everything else in this community, has a definite purpose. That purpose is alertness. Alertness must be bred into every Anonymous. I don't give a fuck for an anon who's not always on his toes. You men are oldfags or you wouldn't be here. You are ready for what's to come. A man must be alert at all times if he expects to stay alive. If you're not alert, sometime, am ACTA son-of-an-asshole-bitch is going to sneak up behind you and get you V& with a sockful of shit! There are over 9000 neatly marked V& papers somewhere. All because one man went to sleep on the job. But they are corporate V&s, because we caught the bastard asleep before they did. Anonymous is a team. It lives, sleeps, eats, and fights as a team. This individual heroic stuff is pure horse shit. The bilious bastards who write that kind of stuff for Fox News don't know any more about real trolling than they know about fapping! We have the finest memes, the finest equipment, the best spirit, and the best men on the internets. Why, by Raptor Jesus, I actually pity those poor sons-of-bitches we're going up against. By Raptor Jesus, I do. I don't want to hear of any anons being captured unless he has been hit. Even if you are hit, you can still fight back. That's not just bullshit either. The kind of man that we want would take out every single motherfuckering asshole before they went to prison. 
The ACTA will be taken out by us right away. I don't want to get any messages saying, "I am not doing anything." By not doing anything we will have let the ACTA do that. We are advancing constantly and we are not interested in holding onto anything, except the ACTA's balls (No Homo). We are going to twist their balls and kick the living shit out of him all of the time. Our basic plan of operation is to advance and to keep on advancing regardless of whether we have to go over, under, or through the enemy. We are going to go through him like crap through a goose; like shit through a tin horn! From time to time there will be some complaints that we are pushing our people too hard. I don't give a good Goddamn about such complaints. I believe in the old and sound rule that an ounce of sweat will save a gallon of blood. The harder WE push, the more chances we stop the ACTA. The less ACTA, the fewer of our men will be V&. Pushing means fewer casualties. I want you all to remember that. There is one great thing that you anons will all be able to say after this war is over and you are home once again. You may be thankful that twenty years from now when you are sitting by the fireplace with your grandson on your knee and he asks you “What you did in the great ACTA raid daddy?” you WON'T have to cough, shift him to the other knee and say, "Well, your Granddaddy shoveled shit offline." No, Anonymous, you can look him straight in the eye and say, "Son, your Granddaddy rode forth with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers! And I did it with a Son-of-a-Goddamned-Bitch name Anonymous!
tl;dr? GET OFF YOUR ASSES! SAVE OUR INTERNETS!
Anonymous. 
We are under attack.
We need help, now. We need to put aside all of our differences and unite under a common cause.
We can do it, because we are anon, we are legion. We cannot let these government agencies win. We have to take action.
The ACTA (Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement) is seeking to put an end to internet anonymity as we know it. We will not be able to post using an anonymous handle. We will not be able to use website like omegle, chatroullete, and youtube. This treaty is seeking to get rid of all the sources that we, anon have used for lulz in the past. We will be effectively disbanded.
We are the only group on the internet that can possibly stand together and pose a threat to them. They knew this. That is why this treaty was discussed in private. Thankfully someone leaked the information and now we have a chance! We can do this! 
We can force the world to realize that we need anonymity. We need anonymous opinions. We need creativity and most importantly, we need each other. I know this is asking a lot, but we have to try. 
Come on /b/. We have stopped every threat so far. All I ask is that we try one more time. For this is the end, if we can defeat this, we have truly showed the WHOLE world that we are powerful. That we decide what happens and what doesn't. 
We shall put up a fight for what we believe in.
Lets do this.

Copypasta 1: [Effectiveness : 8/10 ]
The US Government, the EU, South Korea and other nations are debating and revising a treaty that would give them a killswitch over any content deemed by any person to be infringing upon their copyrights. This power would be granted to them in something they are calling the “Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.” Their justification for creating this is that it would be used to protect intellectual property, and to protect against cyber-warfare attacks. In reality, it simply allows for global government and corporate control over what content is on websites and a means to shut them down, without disclosing their names to the public, effectively allowing them to censor the internet without any consent from the people.
Back in February, Anonymous lauched an assault on the Australian Government’s internet censorship plans, dubbed Operation Titstorm. The attacks were successful, and raised awareness of the bill, causing it to be revised and changed. Now, America... the EU, they're trying to do the same thing Australia did but on a larger scale.
This treaty has thus far been negotiated in the shadows, behind closed doors. The end rounds of negotiation are coming soon before votes of ratification. We must not allow this to happen.

       It's time for Epic Win.
       It's time for /b/, as well as every other Chan to Unite to defeat this.
       What am I talking about?
       ACTA. The Anti-Counterfeit Trade Agreement.
       ACTA will allow websites deemed "unacceptable" to be blocked
       ACTA actually makes p2p illegal, as well as allowing random searches of iPods and Computers.
       Throughout history, /b/. People have been oppressed because they refused to stand up for themselves.
       I hope you learn from their mistakes.
       I'm talking about rallying a Massive Political Campaign across the Internets to fight this treaty.
       We need to fight this, /b/.
       We will make this BIG.
       Bear arms for the sake of your Internets (and lulz). Fight ACTA.
       It is time to use our resources to do something that we believe is right.

Copypasta 4: [Effectiveness 5.5/10]
We must fight ACTA.
ACTA allows them to search your iPods and computers at random, without reason.
ACTA allows them to confiscate your iPods and computers without reason.

ACTA gives the Governments the power to block "inappropriate" websites. This means 4chan.
ACTA allows ISPs to PERMANENTLY ban you from the internet without a trial.
Think about it. We MUST stop ACTA.
If we don't, we will fall. 
Set aside your negativity, stereotypes and cynicism. I ask you know to look with Maturity at this situation.
TL;DR : READ IT YOU LAZY FUCKS
Who's to say 4chan will be spared in the war against the internet?
How do you think China got where they are right now?
Because of Inaction. Because they refused to stand for their beliefs.
We will not. We must fight this. We must fight against ACTA.
Because if there is one thing that could destroy us, it is ACTA.
AT&T wanted to destroy us. We retaliated.
As before, we must retaliate again. It is time again to stand up and fight for our Internets.
Every single one of us is affected. 
Bear arms and fight as Anonymous.
We must must fight this, till our dying breathe

It is time once again to fight for our Internets.
At first, China's internet got censored. We laughed.
Australia was next. We laughed too.
Now, it is our turn. USA, Canada, Europe, Mexico. We are all affected.
ACTA allows them to search your iPods and computers at random, without reason.
ACTA allows them to confiscate your iPods and computers without reason.
ACTA allows them to block websites deemed "unacceptable". This means 4chan.
ACTA will ban p2p clients, like uTorrent
ACTA will allow ISPs to PERMANENTLY Ban you from using the internet, without a trial.
Set aside our differences for a second. Set aside our stereotypes and cynical attitude.
Think. If ACTA is passed, who's to say that we will not suffer?
Who's to say that 4chan will be spared in the mass crusade against free though?
Internet censorship must be stopped. Before it's too late.

### Brander Brand New Copypasta ###

July 2010
The Anti-Counterfeit Trade Agreement is a treaty among nations which is spun as a savior of intellectual property. Face it people, our world is moving into a new era, it won't be long now before what is called a "knowledge economy" is the norm, and these nations recognize that, but they treat knowledge - INFORMATION - as tangible, physical, property. They're dinosaurs; products of their times, and they're trying to force corporatist models onto the way we share information and culture. And in so doing, they will trample the very civil liberties we hold dear. Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States are all on board now, and don't be surprised if once it is passed it is used as a tool to pressure other nations (as if the US doesn't do enough of this with their Special 301 report as it is).
The 3-strikes rule was in an earlier draft, but was struck out of a later version, thankfully, but there's still a great deal to worry about, and a person may still stand to be essentially banned from the internet for infringement. And it goes much deeper than just piracy. We're talking about stifling creativity. We're talking about issues of privacy, of steps being taken towards a surveillance state. ISPs will be put in positions of policing the internet for copyright infringement. Customs will be given the power to do search and seizure of electronics. Arbitrary limitations will be placed on what was once fair use of digital media - any circumvention of DRM, even for personal use, will be illegal, criminal even. What's more, as citizens we're not even given the opportunity to participate in our democracy, as these decisions are being made behind closed doors between government officials and corporate big-wigs.
It's disturbing, to say the least. Sickening, even.
We have drafted a letter to send to representatives, which doubles as a petition that you can sign. I suggest you sign if this concerns you. If you are American this will also send to your representatives in Congress automatically.
<http://www.change.org/petitions/view/act_now_against_acta>
If you are NOT American (many of you are not), you may still copypasta the text in the link above to your representatives as it is written so as to be general enough.
I also suggest you read more. One of the best resources is at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF):
<http://eff.org/issues/acta>
Consider also joining an IRC channel where many of us have banded together:
<http://www.occultusterra.com/>
And we have a site hosting materials and such:
<http://acta.us.to>
But most of all, bring this topic into the public discourse, so more people are aware of what they stand to lose! Make the issues known, and continue to pressure the government. We cannot falter in this important hour.

_"shortened for lulz and effectiveness"_
Hello Anonymous and the Internet. I would advise you to wake up to whats coming to harm our web. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, OR "ACTA" treaty being proposed in secret at the international level, could, and would if passed, ruin our free Internet as we currently know it. In short, this would enforce a "3-strikes and you're out" policy that would result in you and your family being banned from Internet access if you get 3 "accusations" from anybody, of copyright infringement. 
ISPs would now be forced by legal liability to police the web for copyrighted data, and take-down anything that would be assumed copyrighted, and that includes just about any data online since anything may "possibly" be copyrighted. So what this would result in, would be the end of all user generated-based websites. Such as Youtube, Myspace, Rapidshare, Blogs, even the Chans! Finally this would give police around the world strict new powers to confiscate your electronic devices at national and state borders. And if they happen to find copyrighted material on them they may destroy your device and send you the fine! It is time we stand up for our Internet before it is gone. Come join us, in fighting this tyranny!

### Copy-Pasta for V.I.P People, Like Admins of Great sites.   ###

To whom it may concern-
As a user of the Internet, I am concerned with the proposals of the ACTA. If you do not already know, The ACTA (Anti-counterfeiting trade agreement), is an international treaty that is threatening to enact these new international laws:

* That ISPs have to proactively police copyright on user-contributed material. This means that it will be impossible to run a service like Flickr or YouTube or Blogger, since hiring enough lawyers to ensure that the mountain of material uploaded every second isn't infringing will exceed any hope of profitability.
* That ISPs have to cut off the Internet access of accused copyright infringers or face liability. This means that your entire family could be denied to the Internet -- and hence to civic participation, health information, education, communications, and their means of earning a living -- if one member is accused of copyright infringement, without access to a trial or counsel.
* That the whole world must adopt US-style "notice-and-take-down" rules that require ISPs to remove any material that is accused -- again, without evidence or trial -- of infringing copyright. This has proved a disaster in the US and other countries, where it provides an easy means of censoring material, just by accusing it of infringing copyright.
* Mandatory prohibitions on breaking DRM, even if doing so for a lawful purpose (e.g., to make a work available to disabled people; for archival preservation; because you own the copyrighted work that is locked up with DRM) " (<http://boingboing.net/2009/11/03/secret-copyright-tre.html)>
These laws would of course, mean that your website (as well as other sites such as YouTube, flickr and facebook) must be shut down- otherwise, all admins and mods on these (and your) websites would be international criminals.

### Serious Copypasta ###

To whom it may concern.
As a user of the Internet, I am very concerned about the very secretive proposed trade agreement, ACTA (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement). This is an international treaty, the draft of which has been recently leaked, that proposes some radical and potentially disastrous changes to international copyright law, and the way Internet service providers do business.

* Currently, Internet service providers are not held liable for the actions of their customers. ACTA will make ISPs responsible for enforcement of the new legal framework put forth. They will have to police copyright on user-contributed material. This could potentially put an end to sites that depend on such content (Youtube, Flickr, Blogger) due to the impossibility of monitoring the amount of data involved for infringing materials. The only practical option for the ISP would be to block access entirely.
* ISPs will be asked to take a ‘three strikes’ approach, and will have to disconnect users that have been accused of copyright infringements three times, as will be required by law. The user will be disconnected without trial, an opportunity to defend themselves, or even any hard evidence.
* The whole world must adopt US-style "notice-and-takedown" rules that require ISPs to remove any material that is claimed to be infringing, without evidence or trial. This has proved a disaster in the US and other countries, where it provides an easy method of censoring certain people and their websites – just by claiming a copyright violation.
* Stronger laws about breaking DRM measures will be brought into effect, even if you have a legitimate reason to be doing so. 
This treaty isn’t just about ‘preventing piracy and stopping hackers’. The large content distributors have become greedy, and wish to nullify the prominent role the Internet has on entertainment as a whole in the modern world. They can smell their precious money slipping through of their fingers and aren’t afraid to manipulate the democratic process to avoid that. 
Hopefully you can see how their greed will affect you, me, and anyone else that uses the internet. They know that if this treaty becomes common knowledge before being passed, there will be an outcry – that’s why it has been kept secret so long. The passing of this treaty will be disastrous to the Internet as it exists today. It would end the free reign we have had to speak our minds without fear of censorship. 
Do we really want to follow China’s example with Internet policies?
This entire debacle is just another demonstration of how little democracy exists in today’s corporate controlled world, so let’s try take a little bit of it back. 
Fight ACTA.

### Copypasta for Sending to Politicians ###

(added by [Robotlove](User:Robotlove) 18:23, 7 July 2010 (UTC))
This was written for the petition at: <http://www.change.org/petitions/view/act_now_against_acta>
Dear [name],
I was not asked by any party or political movement to send you this message. I write to you now because it has come to my attention, after reading the April, 2010 version of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, that nations signing onto this treaty will use means to prevent intellectual property infringement that damage the fundamental rights of individuals.
While not a feature of the treaty itself, I would first like to express my dismay at how the negotiations of this treaty are being handled. As a citizen of a democratic nation, it is my right to participate in the politics of these negotiations. Without transparency in the process, this very basic right is jeopardized, and yet the process by which these negotiations are taking place is one of secrecy. Frankly, this appears to any objective outside party to be collusion between corporate interests and the government without any consideration of the interests of the general public for whom this treaty will impact the most.
Second, as a citizen of one of these countries, it is one of my fundamental rights to have privacy, and the fact that this treaty includes provisions to limit, among other things, my privacy by the monitoring of Internet traffic is a clear violation of this right. Such practices are highly invasive in the individuals’ private sphere. These practices require that ISPs participate in the generalised monitoring of traffic, and that rights-holders monitor the Internet such as forums, blogs in order to identify file sharers who allegedly exchange copyright material. Such policies will have the end result of increasing the cost of operating Internet services for the service provider, and consequently these costs will be unfairly passed onto the consumer. Furthermore, I believe that the best way to handle Internet service provider liability is the notice-and-notice approach, as this offers the best balance between the rights of intellectual property owners and the rights of individuals for creative and academic expression.
As a user of digital devices, such as portable media devices like the iPod, it is essential that I have the right to transfer media that I have legally obtained in one format to a device that is proprietary to another, such as from a CD to an mp3. Provisions in the ACTA treaty, along with Digital Rights Management technologies will, by virtue of me having converted a CD to a playable format on my personal media player, turn me into a criminal, and make me liable for exorbitant fines. These DRM “digital locks” should be used as a means of preventing circumvention for commercial gain, not to prevent fair uses that are lawful and non-infringing.
Finally, I would like to add that, according to a poll conducted by BBC World Service, four in five people believe that access to the Internet is a fundamental right, not a privilege. As a citizen of one of the countries affected by ACTA, and as an individual living in the modern age of digital information and communication, it is vital to my livelihood that I have access to the Internet, and that this be provided for by law, as the case is in Finland.
It is absolutely essential that you not allow these fundamental rights -- the right to participate in the democratic process, the right to privacy, the right to fair use of digital media, and the right to access the Internet -- be trampled in the name of corporate interests.
Sincerely,
[your name]

## Backup plan ##

In case things get really out of hand and sites get blocked/people cut off for the slightest mistake. Mostly last resort guerilla warfare.
1) Revive [Meshnet](/Meshnet) as this could come in handy quite soon.
2) Download anything needed from Insurgency, because it may get closed down quickly.
3) Make a Back-up IRC channel, disguise it as a Normal Channel

## To Do ##


* Google bomb.
Make the search strings 'ACTA' and 'Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement' have these links as the top results.<br>
<http://www.eff.org/issues/acta><br>

<http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2009/11/actadoc1.pdf><br>
I'm working on something, recommendations on where to place a link farm would be nice. [QueegTheTerminator](User:QueegTheTerminator).
Directing the google searches to anything linked to anonymous is a pretty retarded idea I think.
