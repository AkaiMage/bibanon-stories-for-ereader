Epic Fail Guy is a stick figure character often roleplayed by various [[/b/]]tards and [[Fag#Drawfag|drawfags]]. He is typically shown getting into a situations that seem epic, and promising, but he ends up almost always falling flat on his face.

Most [[Fag#Newfag|newfag]]s only recognise EFG with his mask(the Guy Fawkes mask from V for Vendetta). Without his mask, he has two round circles for eyes, a bald, round head, and very distinctive curved eyebrows.
