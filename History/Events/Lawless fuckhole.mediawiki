[[Image:Xfuopsgone.jpg|thumb|XFU took it kinda hard.]]
On February 1, 2009 at 4:35 GMT, the [[CHANCHAN]] [[:Category:IRC Regulars|IRC channel]] became a lawless fuckhole after [[King_John]] removed ops from everyone in the channel, himself included. After that, it was business as usual, as nobody really gave a shit. There was a general sense of confusion for a while, as some former ops (read: [[User:J-kun|J-kun]] and [[User:Pooru|Pooru]]) seemingly refused to believe in their newly endowed powerlessness.

It has also been described as a "neutral meeting plateau."

== What happened ==
The following are the events that took place, sans insignificant shit:
* [[User:Kyrio|King_John]] removes channel operator status from [[user:badfish|badfish]] [[user:belair|belair]] [[user:j-kun|J-kun]] [[user:nd|nd]] [[user:nynnie|nynnie]] [[user:pooru|Pooru]]

* [[User:Kyrio|King_John]] sets mode -n #chanchan
* [[User:Kyrio|King_John]] sets mode -t #chanchan

On a related note, -kb Sideburns is just as fun as -kb omnom ever was, since it is, effectively, the same thing.
