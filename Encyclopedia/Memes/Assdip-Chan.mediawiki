Meme created when a regular in [[/b/]] had written a detailed description of his homosexual sex at a party. The story goes that the flirty boy of Indian descent provoked unwanted sex by using the words "I dare you" and the act commenced using onion dip as lube. Most images made from the ass-dip story include a colored bronze Bridget, with a bindi on his head with a container of onion dip nearby.
