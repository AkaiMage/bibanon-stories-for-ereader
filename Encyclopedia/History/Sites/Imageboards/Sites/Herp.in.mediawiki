[http://Herp.in/Derp Herp.in/Derp],also known as '''Herpin Derp''' specializing in [[raid]] and [[cancer]] tools. It is a resource for many [[raidfag]]s, allowing them to SMS, Email, and Spam Bombing without needing to download programs to their computer.

==Deathocake.net==
This became the original domain of Herpin Derp, only having the SMS Bomber and Email Bomber at the time. It was very popular until it closed down because of their previous hosting company '''1and1''' banning the domain and host.

After this '''Ugleh''' (creator of Herp.in/Derp) raged and went with an offshore host now known as herp.in

==Things==

The site is named after the phrase "Herpa Derp", seeing as if something could be Herpa it could be Herpin'd allowing a domain hack for the word herp.in and the directory /Derp/.

The "Raiding Hub" was started back in September 2009, and since had a couple hundred unique hits a day. In August of 2010 it was recorded there was an Estimated 3k unique views in just 2 weeks.

With the SMS Bomber, Email Bomber, and Temporary Email Service you'd expect a lot of mail being sent a day. Here is an image showing you how many emails are being sent an hour.

With all this abuse, Herp.in also gets raped threw its bandwidth, with over 2tb of bandwidth a month.
==Creator==
'''Ugleh''' the creator of Herp.in/Derp is a programmer and lazy ass.

For some private information, he is currently in College majoring Web Developer (Just for the degree), he is 20 years old, and he lives by himself in a rented apartment. His light bill is usually $45-51 a month (AWESOME1!!), and he doesn't care if people hold his dox, it just makes him feel more of a threat.

After reading this text message Ugleh decided to create a ban system and a lot of security for shit like that.

Someone asked Ugleh once, why do you name yourself Ugleh?
A: No its not because I dont think I am Ugly, I call myself Ugleh because it looks catchy, its my business's Name, and I like the fact that everyone has the word "sexy" in their username, when the majority of those people are really ugly, so I assume I did the opposite and it stuck.
