I thought that I might add this in since it's similar to Astrolite.

    Nitromethane (CH3NO2)              specific gravity:1.139
    flash point:95f                    auto-ignite:785f

* Derivation: reaction of methane or propane with nitric acid under pressure.
* Uses: Rocket fuel; solvent for cellulosic compounds, polymers, waxes, fats, etc.

To be detonated with a #8 cap, add:

1. 95% nitromethane + 5% ethylenediamine
2. 94% nitromethane + 6% aniline

Power output: 22-24% more powerful than TNT.  Detonation velocity of 6,200MPS.

##  Nitromethane 'solid' explosives

* 2 parts nitromethane
* 5 parts ammonium nitrate (solid powder)

soak for 3-5 min.  when done,store in an air-tight container.  This is
supposed to be 30% more powerful than dynamite containing 60% nitro-glycerin,
and has 30% more brilliance.
