A picture of Slowpoke, a pink sloth-looking Pok√©mon known for its slow speed and lack of intelligence, or a variant therof (Slowbro and Slowking), is generally posted with or in response to a statement that is grievously behind the times, whether intentional, such as "Hey guys, I think Captain America's in trouble!" or or "Hitler's dead, we won!", to unintentional, a good example of which is difficult to find, as it is often difficult to tell if an [[Anonymous]] is sarcastic or not. The reason for this is because slooooooooooooooowpoooooooooooooke is sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow. Sometimes Slowpoke replies will forgo the pic in favor of simply including the text "slowpoke.jpg".
