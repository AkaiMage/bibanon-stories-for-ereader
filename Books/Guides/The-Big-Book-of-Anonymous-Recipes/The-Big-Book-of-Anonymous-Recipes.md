Here, Ladies & Gentlemen, is to be gathered the greatest, biggest, most honorable, tasty, and splendid, list of recipes to ever hit Anonymous's cooking skills. This is based on the pitifully small subsection from [[The Well Cultured Anonymous|The Return of the Well Cultured Anonymous]], with additions discovered from the Well Cultured Wiki and the YSWiki.

## How to Add Recipes

If you set up a new recipe that belongs to a specific kind of dish (such as cookies or crepes), make a new folder for all such recipes under the right course. Leave here only a description, or the most basic recipe of all of them.

## Unit Conversions

[[Conversion Table]]

For convenience it may be a good idea to include the units table in each sub-article and then stick with one unit system throughout - as you will likely write any recipe you try on a piece of paper you can convert to the measurements of your choice. Metric is advisable as it is simpler to scale recipes in a base-10 system if you wish to vary the number of cookies/whatever you produce.

## Salads

What, you don't know how to make salad? What the fuck, you chop the salad, put in croutons and some cheese. There, you have a basic salad.

### Basics

To keep it simple, the most basic rule of salads is that it isn't about what greens you put in; it can be cucumber, lettuce, tomato slices, whatever; all the subtlety lies with the dressing. I'm pretty heavy on sauce myself so I shouldn't really give you any advice on that, but it often goes:

* (olive) oil
* (balsamic) vinegar
* mustard
* pepper
* salt
* random stuff like chili, mint or whatever the fuck you want to put in it.
