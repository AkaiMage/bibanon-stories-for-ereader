==About==
A '''Zip Bomb''' is basically a heavily compressed folder, that when decompresses contains tons of raw shit (Like a few terabytes) which will most likely use up their entire hard drive. It's a pain-in-the-ass prank for somebody you don't like. Don't try to extract it yourself, or face teh consequences.
