# Sweet Home 1985


Well, let's suppose that I am walking home from work on a normal day and boom, I open my apartment door to find out it is 1985.

First comes confusion as I wonder why my apartment looks different. hopefully no one is home. Hopefully something will trigger a sense of the 80s, a magazine or household product. The TV will be old as hell but look new. I turn it on. It is around 6 pm so I am watching the news and there is an earthquake in Mexico City and maybe something about Tipper Gore. I have $20 in my pocket and a wallet full of useless cards that would appear fake to authorities, not to mention no identity.

Sorry past apartment renters, but I gotta rob you. I search the apartment for anything I can take in my over-the-shoulder and maybe make some cash. I'm out the door.

It's 1985. I am 11 in St. Louis. But 37 year-old me has a bag full of stolen goods in Chicago and is a block and half from my grandmother's house. Will my grandmother recognize the 11 year old in the 37 year old me? Is my youngest uncle currently around the corner at The Bubble having a drink? How can I get to St. Louis?

It's 9/19 and in a few weeks the Royals will escape defeat at the hands of the Cardinals with some bullshit call in Game 6. Also, the Bears will win the Super Bowl. Aside from the stolen goods I have an Andriod LG phone, a 5-year old ipod nano and earphones and an USB drive with personal and business files in a file form that probably hasn't been invented yet.

At this point, I've got to get to St. Louis. What will that take in 1985? I can't fly without ID, can I? I am trusting that my parents, will somehow know that I am, in fact, their time-traveling son. I am trusting that parental feeling. But will my grandmother? What if she doesn't... has she moved to Florida yet? I think back to a photo of me on the family station wagon with my sisters visiting my Grandmother in Fort Myers, FL. When was that? I look taller than 11 and I remember wearing a Led Zeppelin T, so probably older than 11. I think she is still on Granville. I'm going there, but first let's get rid of these stolen goods. I don't know hoe long I will be in this neighborhood, so I can't find a Pawn shop around here. I have some watches, jewelry and 36 more dollars. I have two gold coins from 1976 and an antique Mickey Mouse watch with moving hands. I should go downtown, the L is right here and I have 6 dollars in ones. I remember seeing older looking marqees for jewelers downtown north of the Mag Mile. I walk to the Bryn Mawr stop. Thankfully, someone else is getting tokens from this machine I've never seen before and I mimic her actions and get as many tokens as $6 will get me. I have a transit pass in my wallet, but it won't work until 1999 or so.

Things are crazy as hell on what would later be named the Red Line and I am tempted to get out my ipod, but I will need all the power it has to maybe sell it or demonstrate it's use to someone capable.

Walton and Delaware downtown are littered with jewelers and antique dealers. I sell 8 pieces of jewelry at 6 shops to avoid arousing suspicion and get a better price, hoping I don't look like anything but someone who recently lost his Grandmother and these are the pieces we can part with.

It is 7:27 p.m. and I now have $467. I consider avoiding my grandmother altogether. I go over to State and Chestnut, the current "Viagra Triangle" and have a beer. While I am at the bar I hear a laugh I recognize. I look over and see my boss. My boss is an awesome gal, 51 in 2011 but 25 in 1985. 2011 us had recently returned from a two week business trip though HK and Guangdong province.

That's when it hits me. If I get lucky, I can use the tech in my bag to get a job manufacturing this shit in China, may start my own tech hardware company. Hell, even though the items in my possession are basically useless hard drives with programming in languages yet invented, the hard drive, USB and touch-screen tech are invaluable technological headstarts.

First things, first:

Bang my 25-year old boss (she meets her current 2011 husband in 3 months!)

Get to St. Louis.

First thigns first I wake up in Lincoln Park. It is Friday 9/20/1985 and NPR reminds me of this as my 25-year old 2011 boss is showering. I am making coffee as she emerges. I has used all the information 8 years of being colleagues and 5 seasons of How I met Your Mother to get her into bed. I shower and redress and we head down to the train together. I had lied and said I had a job at Leo Burnett, the only company i could remember being downtown that would surely already be there in 1985 (thanks Mad Men). I promise to call her after I get back from my weekend trip to St. Louis.

I walk to Union Station and I am in luck. I can purchase a ticket without ID. I lurk in the Union Station gift shop, buying a TIME, Forbes and a Newsweek. I also get a Chicago Tribune and a New York Times. Also a Barron's. My Mom's Dad read Barron's religiously and I hope this will help. I expect I am going to have to pull one of those "I know things only I could know" routines. I have 6 hours to kill before the 3 o'clock train. I have $412 after the tickets and periodicals and 6 hours to read them on the train. I will arrive in St, Louis around 9 pm. I can take a cab to a hotel near my family's house, so maybe I should get some clothes.

I walk to Macy's, wait... still Marshal Fields. I see a Nintendo, brand new for $129.99 and the 11 year old inside me wants to get it for myself. My parents never got me one, I played early games on a Commodore 64. Who knows how much I will need the money, so I focus on clothes. I get a pack of boxers, Ts, and a pair of Levi's 501 jeans. As I spend the money, I start to get really nervous about the predicament I am in. I can't spend anymore money unless I need to. I head back to Union Station and lounge on the wooden benches around the old clock. I start reading up on the events I already lived through as an oblivious 11 year old. Crocket and Tubbs are on the cover, they found the Titantic and Reagan messes with the Fed. Newsweek: South Africa, Apartheid.

I take the 6 hour train trip to St. Louis, dozing and reading about Fall of 1985. When I arrive, I get a taxi to take me to this old hotel in downtown Clayton, the closest I remember to my old house. As the taxi leaves, I start walking. It takes me 45 minutes to get to the ole place. We moved in when I was 6 or maybe 7. We would move out in, I think, two years. I'm nervous. It is after 10 and I stand on the street down the big hill. My main childhood home sits atop with my whole 1985 family, probably asleep by now. Tomorrow is Saturday. I wish maybe it was Friday, then I'd have just my mom to talk to. Then I think maybe it is better to have Dad there too, she'd be more inclined to talk with Dad there. Maybe it is better to have 11 year old me there to compare to? Maybe not. I know where I can sleep nearby, in a big bush we used as a fort as kids. It's bushy and soft and has a nice hollow inside, I can sleep there until morning.

"I don't know, I don't think we need to call the cops."

"Son.... Son. Wake-up son"

I am jostled awake by an elderly man. Mr. Campbell. I remember you, what are you doing in Chicago Mr. Campbell, I thought you were dead.

"Well, I'm not dead Son and this isn't Chicago."

I look up at Mr. Campbell. He's been dead for 22 years in 2011. 2011! 1985! I remember my predicament and I bolt upright at the waist.

"I'm sorry Mr. Campbell... I...know how much you like your bushes"

I stammer like the child was when Mr. Campbell would catch us in the bushes after he came home from work or at night. I quickly grab my bag and stand upright. I had never stood in those bushes as an adult and it turns out I'm much taller at 37. As I stand I see my father looking at me. He has his hand on my 11 year-old shoulder. I look at him. He has more hair and then it dawns on me. He was 27 when I was born. I would have just turned 11, so he's actually 38, going to be 39 in December. We are the same age. I look at my 11-year old self. I have bushy red hair and cords on. A striped polo shirt and reeboks. I have my arms crossed across my chest and I'm squinting in the sunlight. I'm at a loss for words. I had hoped I would wake up with the light, and been able to come up to the house and knock on the door. Now I look like a hobo, an oddly well dressed one.

"He looks like Uncle John." says 11-year old me. I do, I always have.

As I say this, my father looks right at me and I can tell from the look on his faces he agrees, that I do look like my mothers youngest brother, who is in fact younger than 2011 me in 1985.

I've got to get out of here. I wasn't ready for this and there are other people around. Mr. Campbell's was... IS.. across the street and two houses down and there are other kids on the street. that's why we lovd it some much. Four of them are hanging around my Dad: Mike, Abby, Beth and Elizabeth. I see Elizabeth's Dad standing on his porch with a weed trimmer. He is looking at us all. I really fucked this up. I would have set the alarm on my phone, but that would require it be on all night and god knows you can't keep a charge over night.

"Uh, sorry folks. I got locked out of my condo."

I wiggle out of the bushes and gingerly move towards the old fence behind Mr. Campbell's that led behind the large condo buildings that our old little neighborhood hid behind. I move through the gap in the fence we used all the time. My Dad is still looking at me, but not like I'm about to be confronted by Chris Hansen on Dateline. I turn to walk, quickly to the condos and I can see my Mom's car is gone from the drive way. She's out. Where is she?

I turn the corner behind a building to stop and get out of sight of all my old neighbors and, you know, MYSELF! I stand there and my heart is pounding. I hadn't thought any of that through and I screwed it up royally before I even began. Shit, I could just tell my dad that and he'd understand. Well, my 2011 Dad would. At 11 I've really only screwed up once. When I was 8 my Dad built this really nice two tiered wooden deck on the front of our house. It covered this ugly simple concrete set of steps and replaced with this much larger, nicer two-level deck with stairs and benches. That summer, I used the deck as a base for my G.I. Joe toy. I used a permanent sharpie to mark of where the vehicles landed and the helicopter should land. He was supremely pissed. I grin to myself and laugh. I look up and I see a For Sale sign... Coldwell Banker, with my mother's name on it.

She's showing property. My mother went back to work son after my youngest sister turned 4, so about one year ago, 1984. I would need to call her and see what house she was showing. I reached for my phone. Of course, there isn't going to be a cellular signal. I would need a payphone. Jesus Christ, when was the last time I used a pay phone on the street? Where was there one?

I remembered the Baskin Robbins had one, right next to the Pantera's Pizza (I LOL'd). I bought a shake and got some quarters and dialed my mom's office number by heart. Still the same in 2011 as it was in 1985. The receptionist informed my of the location of the showing and the time. I planned to show up when it was over, 1pm; and I would need all that time to walk there. 1926 High School Avenue, my old friend Mark Bassmens house. We had been close friends until his parents put him in a expensive private prep school in 6th grade, they moved further out into the suburbs of St. Louis County. Jesus, this had been my last summer with Mark, in 1985. When school started I went back to St. Mary's and he went to Loyola.

I started walking, if I moved quickly I could get there by noon. I had an hour and more to plan how to do this. I really wish I had bought a watch. A watch would be handy right now. As far as I'm concerned my android power is sacred and who even knows if the clock would work. I've tried to judge the wisdom of turning it on and fiddling around to see what it says, versus conserving power. I've walked around the block three times. This time, I stand in front, across the street. I see the tree-house Mark and I played in, long gone by now in 2011. I see my Mother start to escort a couple out of the front door and I make my move. No need to make myself look any more odd. My dress has always been conservative, buttons down, slacks, etc. So I don't look too far removed from the stereotypical preppy guy, even the Chuck Taylors are around in 1985, but who knows. I have a messenger bag that is definitely NOT 1985 and glasses too, but who notices that?

"Hello! Welcome to the showing."

"Yes, good afternoon."

Come on in, we've had a lot of people today, but it looks like you might be the last. Are you alone?"

"Yes..."

"Not a problem at all, are you familiar with the neighborhood?"

"Very... I grew up here. I haven't been back in 25 years."

"Well, welcome back then."

My mother leads me through the house and we exchange pleasant banter about the house. She is 34, the exact age of my girlfriend in 2011. She has had three kids though and I am reminded of those years when we were young, how she struggled to loose weight. She looks so young to me though, but she is still Mom. She is still Melissa, that woman who is my Mom. We come back down from the second level and look out from the kitchen into the back yard.

"So that is where Mark and Josh played?"

"Excuse me?"

"Mark Bassmen and his friend, Josh?"

"Um... yes... You know the Bassmens, then?"

"I would say I know then very well..."

"But you look to be my husbands age and you've not lived here for 25 years? Do you know Mr. Bassman?"

"Yes, I do."

My mother is tactful and sharp, she is looking at me intently. it is nerve-wracking and all too familiar. In a moment of tension, I default and whip out my phone. I go to unlock it with a swipe and she sees it. It is turned off so doesn't take my orders. I look at it's blank screen with the smudge across the bottom, my desperate attempt to shield my 37 year-old self from my 11-year old Mother's inquisitorial gaze.

"What is that?"

"This is nothing..." As I realize my slip up, I begin to put it back in my pocket, but them I see the look on her face, it has softened into interest. My Mother was always a scifi fan. She gave me copies of The Martians Chronicles and Rendezvous with Rama. We shared that love of Sci-fi all our lives together. Heinlein, Niven, Dick. She loved Dan Simmons when I gave her a copy of Ilium. This could be what I need.

"Actually, it is something straight out of Star Trek."

"Intriguing..."

"Here take a look." I power it up. It makes the Android noise and the screen comes on. I slide to unlock. My girlfriends face is the screensaver and a without skipping a beat, my mother says, "She's cute." I don't know what to do, everything about this device is 20 years beyond where she lives now. There are icons all over my screen: Angry Birds, Bubble Blast, MyFitness, Messaging and Contacts.

"What is this little symbol.. looks like a phone."

"It is a phone. A camera too, take a look." I open up the camera and take a picture of her. I remember this very phone has picture of her grandchildren, my sister's kids.

See, I took a picture of you..." I am looking at the phone, but I see she is finally and rightly nervous. I hope I didn't push it too far.

"Someday everyone will have one of these..."

She looks at me, a little afraid. I take out my wallet and I being to empty it on the kitchen counter. My ID, my credit cards, my frequent flyer cards, my Dominicks cards, my Best Buy Reward Zone. I lay them all out in front her, with my ID right in front.

She looks right at it. Then I said what might have been the perfect thing.

"I'm just as afraid and nervous as you are right now."

"Well, I highly doubt that."

I move around the counter across from her and I slowly remove my ipod, the USB drive. I begin to empty my bag, newspapers and magazines I bought for the train, but also the WIRED I had from August. The Chicago Reader from earlier that week. I have folded up crossword puzzles I saved from the Chicago Red Eye to do on the train, all with dates all over them.

"I'm from 2011. I'm Josh Carlisle from 2011, I'm 37 years old. All of this here is what I have and you can ask me any question you want until you are satisfied that I am who I say I am." "oh really..." she says. "This is all very interesting. Am I supposed to go through all of this and be convinced of something? You don't look like you need money, so I'm at a loss to uncover what you want form a real estate agent in the suburbs."

"I can't say what I want. As you can imagine this is a rare situation to say the least. Of course, I don't expect you to believe me, not right away. I don't have a lot of choices, well, legal choices and I've never been one to dabble in illegal solutions... you taught me that."

She looks up at me holding a United Airlines reward card. "Member since 2009" it says on the front. It has been sitting in my wallet for years and is scratched all over. She places it down and picks up my ID again. 2011 IL drivers licenses have a water mark on them and she tilts it back a forth.

"This is a lot of trouble to go through and I'm not sure what reward you are hoping to get."

"Don't you even want hear the whole story of how I traveled through time and got here?"

"Sure..." She reviews everything on the counter as I tell her about returning home to a home taken back in time. About becoming a thief and getting some cash. I talk about taking the train and reading about 1985 on the way home. I tell her that I knew that everyone I was friends with as an adult was a child, that every older colleague and mentor was now my age and likely to think me a clown. Who would I have in a world I've been removed from by 26 years of time, something I thought previously immutable. If my own Mother and Father couldn't look me in the eye and see who I was, then where was I to begin? No where, no where I'd know about. I would be really and truly alone. Left adrift in a new old world with nothing, no identity, no family, no skills or training I could document and only and few hundred dollars. No home, no car and not even a full change of clothes. All I have is a loose memory of 26 years yet to play out that would probably come screaming back at inconvenient and useless moments.

"I feel like Merlin in The Once and Future King. I believe your copy was given to you by your college English teacher."

She removes her hands from the counter, but stops short of taking a step back.

"I can answer lots of questions like that, questions only I can answer."

"Which is really where all this is headed isn't it? Unless I call the police and have you arrested."

"Isn't that the most likely ending here? I know you have some faith in things unseen, but my unwavering practicality comes from you. Time-travel is impossible, at least highly improbable, and you'd be foolish to believe it."

"This is your wallet from 2011?" She says lifting up my flappy, empty leather wallet.

"Yep."

She removes the money from inside and starts reading them. "2007. 2009. 1999. 1998. 1981! 1987. 2010. You know, the papers and cards would be somewhat easy to make for someone with an agenda, but this is difficult. Counterfeit money is hard to make and if you can do it, you wouldn't need to con people."

"A reasonable hypothesis."

"My 11 year old son... who you claim to be, said that same thing to me today when I asked if he was going to put off doing his homework until Sunday night. Tell me something I don't know."

"I wasn't supposed to be your first child."

My mother is a woman who is hard as nails. Perhaps she didn't expect her 37 year old son to know she had a misscarriage before she carried me to term. Perhaps she didn't expect her 37 year-old time traveling son to cut to the bone so quickly.

"But, the doctors might now that and I could have talked to them. As part of my elaborate hoax, right? How about I tell you when I knew Santa Claus was you and Dad. Two years ago, and I mean 1983, you and Dad got me new bike for Christmas. Dad's Mom was staying with us for Christmas so I was sleeping on the air mattress in the girls room. The combination of anxiety and unusual sleeping arrangements meant I was resting fitfully as best. You and Dad have always made Christmas great, laying out the gifts in the Living Room as if Santa had left them. Well, this year I thought I had slept all night. I got out of bed and walked into the Living Room. The only thing that had been set out was my great new red ten-speed bike. You walked into the room, saw me and shooed me quickly out of the room. When I woke up after sleeping the night away, finally, I saw the bike and my brain knew that you and Dad were Santa. I never told the girls."

She looked me in the eye.

"Gather your things, I need to call my husband. Don't go anywhere."
