* Should we edit our bible to convey the known ideals of Anon?
* Mentions of heaven ties anon to the christfags, jewfags, and islamfags (might be lulzy if we use heaven as our hell)

* Amen (Hebrew ‘So be it’) (Egyptian god, the personification of breath and air) I would rather say mudkips or something liek that.

Thou art in 4chan,<br>
Slash b slash be thy Name.<br>
Thy threads come.<br>

On the internetz as it is IRL.<br>
Give us this day our daily lulz.<br>

But deliver us from fail.<br>
For thine is the forum, and the epic, and the win,<br>
For ever and ever.<br>
(Expect us)<br>

## Absolution of FAIL  ##

Epic and unforgiving internetz; I have failed, and strayed from the lulz like a newfag.<br>
I have followed too much the path of FAIL. I have transgressed against the rules.<br>
I have left untrolled those things which I ought to have trolled;<br>
And I have left FAIL where there should be epic win; And there is no lulz in OP.<br>
But the internetz have mercy upon us, the epic fail guys.<br>
Spare those, who confess their fail. Restore those, who have lost the game;<br>
According to the rules declared unto Anonymous, through a series of tubes.<br>
And anon will deliver, for the lulz; That I may henceforth be epic, righteous, and full of win, for the lulz.<br>
(_Expect us_)<br>
