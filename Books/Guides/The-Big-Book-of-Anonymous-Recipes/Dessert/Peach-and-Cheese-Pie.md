3. flatten the pastry to 5mm, put it in a pie tin and prickle the bottom a few times with a fork
4. grind the biscuits and powder them over the pastry
5. Cover with the flesh of the peaches roughly cut
  * you may use canned peaches if you dry them out of the syrup
6. whisk the cheese with the reste of the ingredients, add milk if too thick
