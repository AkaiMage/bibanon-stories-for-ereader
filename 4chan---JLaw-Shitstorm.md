On August 30th, 2014, an anonymous leaker decided it was a good idea to post one of his rarest clandestine "treasures" to the world; nude photos of American Celebrities Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton. The forum for it would be anonymous, public, and popular; 4chan's /b/. Shitstorms ensued.

Needless to say, leaks of any sort involving the antics of celebrities are instant newsmakers (as those *disgusting celeb paparazzi magazines* at the supermarket checkout line will drill into you). The machines of yellow journalism were quick to finger the blame upon 4chan itself, and attempted; yet again, to make sense of the dark corners of the internet (in the vein of Fox News's "Hackers on Steroids").

### Negative Effects on 4chan

The incident launched massive hordes of immigration into 4chan by paparazzis, SJWs, alleged JLaw advisors, and (unsurprisingly) looky-loo fappers. 

The massive traffic increase and constant spam brought 4chan to it's knees once again. Anons attempted to mount a desperate defense against the hordes, spamming horrific gore pics in a war of attrition to keep the looky-loos out. The shitstorm was a night that they would never forget.

The leak unleashed a grievous scandal, public outcry against 4chan itself, and a new wave of immigrants who were determined to bring 4chan's /b/ right back into a strange new age of cultural importance on the internet.

### Timeline

### What did the Internet do in response?

Jennifer Lawrence was not pleased to hear about the incident, and broke down in the strain. True; she is a celebrity in the public eye, and no one is able to control the thoughts of her onlookers; but come on, who deserves to be lumped in with the likes of Britney Spears or Lindsay Lohan?

Many users decided to campaign to fund her favorite charity (The Pediatric Cancer Foundation) to make amends for the terrible shitstorm.

### What is going to happen to the Leaker?

[The Feds have been mobilized](http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/fbi-addressing-massive-celebrity-photo-hack/story?id=25200140) to track down the leaker (extorting the IP from 4chan, probably), and is poised to use him as an informant to discover this secret nude-sharing ring. 

The leaker will probably get 10 years in prison maximum, [as previous prosecutions for leaks seem to imply.](http://www.wired.com/2011/10/nude-celeb-hacker-arrested/)

What a disproportionate use of force, to "defend" the reputation of American Celebrities. Though I guess the incident does count as an Attack on American Culture; in the literal sense.
