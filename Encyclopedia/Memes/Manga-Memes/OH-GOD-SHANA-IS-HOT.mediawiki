[[Image:1180534659293.gif|thumb|right|200px|OH GOD SHANA IS HOT]]Refers to the heroine of the anime ''Shakugan no Shana''. Shana's badass personality and habit of yelling "Shut up, shut up, shut up!", along with a propensity of the animators to draw her in swimsuits, endeared her to fanboys on /a, although the fact that she clearly fits into the loli category precludes the meme from spreading into [[/e/]] or [[/h/]]. Also seen as OH GOD LOUISE IS HOT, referring to the female lead of ''Zero no Tsukaima'', who is pretty much acknowleged to be Shana with a color-palette swap, the serial numbers filed off and a riding crop replacing the sword.
