## Must-sees

_The very best of the best._

### Unexpected Glory

* [[Puella Magi Madoka Magica]] - The very best anime of 2011. Masquerading as a stereotypical magical girl anime, it forces a darkly Faustian plot through the weak moral values of the genre. 
   * The magic of the narrative and the hidden secrets within turned otakus of trivial background into cryptographers, mathematicians, philosophers, and spectulating intellectuals within weeks. Nowhere else will you find a fanbase just as enlightened.
* [[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]] - It's Evangelion done right. GAINAX's Gurren Lagann is a return to the glorious mecha anime that made Japanese TV worth watching in the first place.
* [[End of Evangelion]] - 

### The Epic Adventure

* [[Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood]] - Prussian militarized fighting alchemists with a touch of Eastern magic FTW. Yes.
* [[Trigun]] - FUCK YEAH SPACE WESTERNS

### Supreme Disappointments

_Great idea, bad execution. Still worth a watch for cultural importance._

* [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]] - GAINAX's classic mecha deconstruction of the 1990s. The mess of Christian symbolism and it's indecipherable ending caused no end of aggravation from it's fans.
* [[Fullmetal Alchemist]] - Prussian militarized fighting alchemists FTW. Not as cool when they all go to the Nazis.

## Classics

_The trailblazers that made anime worth watching in the first place._

* [[Akira]] - The dark, futurepunk movie that began the trend of fighting teenagers. It's pretty good.
* [[Dragonball Z]] - If you were a little kid in America, it wasn't easy to miss this series.
