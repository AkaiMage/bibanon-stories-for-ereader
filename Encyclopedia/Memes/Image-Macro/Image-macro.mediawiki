[[Image:catfail.jpg|thumb|250px|One of the most generic image macros ever.]]
An '''image macro''' is a picture with "witty" (read: retarded) text added via [[Photoshop]] or other image editors. They often use text from existing [[memes]], and in some cases cause the creation of new ones.

Image macros became so prevalent that they are now banned from all boards except [[/b/]]. While the ban was initially enforced rather strictly, it eventually fell by the wayside and now macros are posted almost with impunity throughout [[4chan]]. Even if the macro isn't even related to the subject of the board.

Image macros are typically used in the stead of originality, and are thus commonplace in boards like [[/b/]]. The use of an image macro, as previously stated, was a major infraction after the crackdown, and actual enforcement of the rules. Remember, the [[Internet]] is [[serious business]].
