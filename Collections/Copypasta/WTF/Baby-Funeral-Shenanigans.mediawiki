A rather <s>disturbing</s> lulzy bit of [[Copypasta]] about a man who offends a bunch of old people at a baby's funeral.

== Original Copypasta ==
Hi

So today I was walking to work when I saw a funeral in progress at Forest Lawn 
cemetery. Since I was already wearing a suit (required for my job) and I was pretty 
early for work, I decided to pop in to see what was going on. I walked up the marble 
path, up to a rather large memorial service (about 250-300 people) for what appeared 
to be a baby that had died shortly after birth. The family really went all out, the 
tombstone was massive and the coffin had gold embroidering, really nice. The people 
looked about what you would expect, all dressed up, mothers were crying, and even 
a few fathers couldn't hold back their tears.

Well about 15 minutes in, after the opening hymn, people started to filter up to 
the microphone to express their condolences to the family. The grandfather said 
some words about how everything is a blessing even if it doesn't seem like it, 
the brother of the father reassured the family that, if they ever needed anything, 
that the family was there for them.

Then a man walked up, about in his late 40's, and said "Although I don't really 
know the family, or the deceased that well, I want to say, I'm sorry for your loss. 
I too have lost a child." He walked from the mic, over to the families, shook their 
hand and walked away.

He didn't know the family? So, it seemed ANYONE could say something at the funeral.

I straightened my tie, put on my most sorrowful expression, and walked towards the 
front. I approached the man holding the microphone and, in my most solemn tone, asked 
if I might say a few words. The man smiled warmly and handed me the microphone, 
completely oblivious to what was about to happen.

I turned to face the crowd, all intently looking at me with the most [[Emo|melancholy]] and 
tearful eyes you've ever seen. I cleared my throat and said my piece:

"What's the difference between a dead baby and a sandwich? I DON'T FUCK A SANDWICH BEFORE I EAT IT!"

The crowd was horrified. The sound manager tried to unplug the speakers before I could 
finish my joke, but to no avail; he didn't react fast enough and couldn't get himself 
together before the punchline rang through the cemetery.

The crowd went fucking batshit. The reaction started with sheer shock and horror, and ended 
in a blind rage, with everyone, even some of the WWII veterans and grandmothers in the crowd, 
trying to tackle me to the ground.

Being that I was a football running back in high school, I was much faster than everyone there. 
Good thing too, God knows what would have happened if they caught me. Probably have thrown me 
into the grave with their failure of a living baby. I had to run around for a bit, but I eventually 
made my way to the western exit. I've never had so many lulz in my entire life.

What did you do today?
