The basic idea of this project is to take the Bible as a template and change it so that it reflects the belief and culture of Anon.

This was planned to be the holy book of [[The Church of Anon]]. Because of it's useful historical content, much of the Books have been incorporated into other parts of this library.

## Suggestions and Comments ##

* Unique spiritual texts, not mock-uments of jewfag and christfag bibles. (we're better than that)
* 3-10 ceremonial descriptions (marriage, communion, burial rites, baptism, ect)
* make it funnier, shit sucks
* get ED involved
* Why are there books not linked through here(Example; The Book of Jailbait)? Someone's got sum 'splainin to do.
> _It means that book doesnt exist_
Related: [Lolcat Bible](http:www.lolcatbible.comindex.php?title=Main_Page), we can use this for inspiration, pasta, ideas, etc. sure beats the hell out of the regular bible. 
I'm no fucking writer but is anyone actually working on the missing books? Seriously? I'll start asking around for writers, but you guys need to sort your shit out or take the book topic out. Also you should know that a spoof on the jewfag and christfag books would hardly be original or worth publishing.
> "We've gotta have SOME framework, might as well piss off the jewfags and christfags while we're at it. This is good for now. We can always changeedit it later."
