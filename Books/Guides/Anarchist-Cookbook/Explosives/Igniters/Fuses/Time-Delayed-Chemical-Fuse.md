1. Put 1 teaspoon full of of potassium permanganate in a tin can.
2. add a few drops of glycerine
3. wait 3-4 min.
4. get the hell out..  the stuff will smoke, then burst into flame..

potasium permanganate stains like iodine but worse [it's purple]

the reaction will spatter a bit ->it can be messy...

it doesn't matter if the amounts are uneven [ie.  1 part to 3 parts]
