Amatol is a high explosive, white to buff in color. It is a
mixture  of  ammonium  nitrate and TNT, with a relative effectiveness slightly
higher  than  that  of  TNT  alone. Common compositions vary from 80% ammonium
nitrate  and  20%  TNT  to 40% ammonium nitrate and 60% TNT. Amatol is used as
the  main  bursting  charge  in  artillery  shells  and  bombs. Amatol absorbs
moisture  and  can  form dangerous compounds with copper and brass. Therefore,
it should not be housed in containers of such metals.
