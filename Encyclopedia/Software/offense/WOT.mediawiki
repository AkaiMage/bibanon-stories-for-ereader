[http://anonym.to/http://www.mywot.com/ WOT] is a corruption of W.O.T., which stands for Web Of Trust.<br>
With WOT you can damage the trustworthiness of EVERY website on the internet.<br>
If the rating is damaged, people can't visit the site properly because of annoying warnings on every page.
=About=
WOT allows users to add their input on the safety of a website ranging from very dangerous to very safe, based on how safe they believe a website to be. WOT estimates the overall reputation of a website through a combination of user ratings and the incorporation of gaining and earning trust, which is calculated through an activity score. The activity score is a number given based on the number of websites rated, comments left, and forum posts made. This equates to a ranking, based on how high the number, and gives the titles of rookie-, bronze-, silver-, gold-, or platinum-level rater. The higher the score, the more your individual rating makes a difference in the overall reputation, combined with others' ratings, blacklists, and trusted sources, and is displayed to users upon entering a website or viewing it in search results.
==tl;dr Version==
*Ratings:
**Rate enemy websites giving them a 0 in each of the 4 categories.
**Give many other sites ratings to increase your influence, as your votes become stronger as you contribute.
*Comments
**Give enemy websites red comments, which give them 1 red point in the category.
**Vote red comments up for 1 extra point in that category.
**Vote green comments down to delete 1 point and make them invalid if they have a negative score.
''Side note: You get your activity points after a few hours to a few days, so don't cry around.''
