"Cool Story Bro" is the name of a famous story posted to /r9k/ on January 27, 2012, posted by an anon named Dan (who confusingly called himself [[Uncle Anon]], but is unrelated to the original). His tripcode is `Dan/UncleAnon !!JcDj4Fv3Vfi`.

---

Dan tells a harrowing tale, about a day when he opened his door to see a woman begging him for help; one that betrayed his love, shattered his trust, and stole from his family. 

He nearly slams the door, but the woman shows Dan her battered body; morbid proof that her new boyfriend has been abusing her for years, and is trying to hunt her down right now. 

And despite the odds, Dan, conflicted between deep-seated hatred, fear of retribution, and lingering love, reluctantly gives a safe haven to a woman whose transgressions he once deemed "unforgivable".

## Original Run

There were two threads posted to /r9k/, `12296527` on January 27, 2012, and a continuation in `1243804` on January 28 - 29.

## Remastered Chapters

The Bibliotheca Anonoma has remastered the story by restoring the replies by fellow anons to the story. They form an important part of the context by motivating Dan's storytelling, creating derivative works on the fly, and poking fun at the oddities in his life. 

Dan constantly used run-on sentences and rarely used periods, so the original form was difficult to follow and hard to read. Thus, we have broken up his sentences and added periods, and rearranged some posts. Otherwise, we have edited nothing else.

## Alternative Storylines

Before Dan made a tripcode, a few ghostwriters submitted troll posts to screw with their fellow anons while waiting for him to finish typing. 

However, some of those stories ended becoming interesting fanfiction in their own right.
