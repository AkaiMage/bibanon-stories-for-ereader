Translates to "in before". The phrase is posted to predict that an established [[meme]] will soon be posted in the thread. (Examples: OP: "ITT: Post CP" "Inb4 Captain Picard")

If the predicted meme is indeed posted, a reply of '''In after *.''' may follow. Slightly more rarely, the initial prediction may be replied to with '''In with *.''' or '''In during *.''' It can also be applied to [[Fag#Tripfag|tripfags]] who have predictable behavior and will often post in such thread that are relevant to their interest.

An alternative use of '''In before''' is to prevent future posters from posting that meme, since no one likes to look like an idiot.

=== In before Libertine ===
A meme used on [[CHANCHAN]] during the time the pedophile who went by [[Libertine]] was posting. In order to start his grooming process, Libertine would comment on every [[loli]]'s thread moments after she started posting.

The meme was also seen as '''in b4 lib'''.
:* ''See: [[Libertine]]''
