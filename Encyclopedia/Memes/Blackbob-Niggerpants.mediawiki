'''Blackbob Niggerpants''' is a gangster version of SpongeBob Squarepants, made famous in a [[Flash]] loop where he's walking down a street with a mean attitude and "Who Da Buckest" by Juicy J blaring in the background. An alternate version plays "She Devil" by TECH N9NE. After being flooded [[Reidick]]-style for a long time and generating many complaints from [[/f/]]tards, the file was uploaded permanently (not really though since it's not there now) to /f/src/ by the mods. Regardless, edits, counteredits and other spin-offs still get posted to /f/ a lot, mostly to get a rise out of the /f/tards who cannot help but reply to such threads with their hatred and a lot of "[[sage|zOMG SAGE]]".

Blackbob Niggerpants was first posted before the middle of 2008. The standard filename is '''blackbob.swf'''.
