A comedy-drama anime, based on the manga by Azuma Kiyohiko, about the lives of a group of Japanese high-school girls and their quirky adventures together. Similar in tone to the old Peanuts specials or Calvin and Hobbes. Wildly popular on the Japanese BBSes, and the closest thing [[4chan]] has to an official favorite anime. Azumanga Daioh was the source for many early 4chan memes, such as Osakaphone. The girls from AD are reposted frequently on [[/a/]], [[/b/]], /c/ and /e/; Osaka is probably the most popular character, owing to her spacey manner and nearly constant smile (both of which many [[4chan]]ners find irresistible; she's even considered a goddess by some [[/b/]]tards), followed by Yomi (whose matter-of-factness, glasses and more adult figure "JELLY ROLLS" are usually cited) and Chiyo-chan (who's just plain cute).
