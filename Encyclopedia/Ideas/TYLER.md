TYLER is a proposed "Massively Distributed Uncensorable Collaborative Wiki-P2P Cipherspace Structure". While the writings of Project Mayhem do outline the ideals and implications of such a website, very little has been written or done on actually implementing the idea.

But wait a second, a decentralized wiki? That sounds familiar... Something like this wiki? Yes, we have already accomplished half of the goals of TYLER, the DVCS wiki part. However, more needs to be done on making the access p2p and editing more decentralized, and so we've put a design specification for such a wiki [[here|Ukiyo-e]].

## Introduction

At the time of writing this (June 15, 2010), WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange is being hunted by Pentagon over a possibly massive 260.000 diplomatic cables leak, after ex-'hacker' Adrian Lamo turned the supposed whistleblower to the FBI and ex-'hacker' Kevin Poulsen broke the very 1st rule of journalism on Wired by revealing his name.

Daniel Ellsberg, who gained fame when he leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971 in hopes of ending the Vietnam War, told MSNBC's Dylan Ratigan that he not only sees a parallel between himself and the person who recently leaked a video of an assault by US forces on Iraqi civilians but also fears for the safety of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who published the video.

> “What if WikiLeaks was a sort of Wiki-BitTorrent, served by thousands of people around the world running a background process on their computers. No fundraising needed here, it’s all P2P. And if the Wiki is maintained Wikipedia style, then we no longer need to pay for a centralized staff to curate it. Plus, there’s no centralized staff to kill or jail. It can be a decentralized, collaborative process.”

WikiLeaks has started to serve Magnet links, yet the role of the Editor (Julian) is maintained in order to supervise and to assign priorities to what is leaked and what is not.

Unfortunately, this puts the role of the Editor in great personal danger and in risk of being 'totally incapacitated' —CIA's term to refer to Daniel Ellsberg— by potential enemies while it dramatically slows down the release process.

By its own nature, WikiLeaks mirror servers are limited in numbers, and very much resource-hungry during media peaks. 

Being limited in numbers means that they are prone to attack, DDoS, international IP bans, governmental inclusion in blacklists... etc. etc. These are single point of failure that threaten the infrastructure of the whole system.

Project Mayhem 2012 aims to circumvent these issues.

Project Mayhem 2012 turns into a real uncensorable Superorganism that
predates the net: 

> an uncensorable civil cipherspace ontop the cyberspace.

In other words, we would like to help Mr. Obama to fulfill his promises and to make them extensible to the whole of society. World. Wide.

### Protect Whistleblowers:

> "Often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance. Barack Obama will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government. Obama will ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process."

## "Ordo ab KOH." Use soap.

> The saponification of fats with KOH is used to prepare the corresponding "potassium SOAPS," which are softer than the more common sodium hydroxide-derived soaps. Because of their softness and greater solubility, potassium soaps require less water to liquefy, and can thus contain MORE CLEANING AGENT than liquefied sodium soaps.

TYLER is a massively distributed and decentralized Wikipedia-style P2P
cipherspace structure impregnable to censorship.

TYLER will avoid single point of failures by implementing a distributed
and crowdsourced karma-based TRUST 'Authority' in order to prioritize leaks
relevance and visibility while minimizing information poisoning.
This solution successfully solves the single point of failure inherent to
the role of an Editor.

TYLER will gather an unprecedented number of the best hackers and coders
ever to develop its structure from scratch, from the lessons learned from
the Freenet, TOR, GNUnet, eMule, BitTorrent, I2P, Tribler and related
projects.

TYLER will end its betatesting phase the 5th of noVember, 2012.
TYLER will go wild on the net on 12-12-2012, massively flashmob style.

Machines are usually hacked via 'interlink bugs'.
Humans are usually hacked via 'limbic system bugs'.
This date has been purposely chosen to PLAY with the 2012 meme.
As everybody knows, it's OBVIOUS that prophecies & MagicK do **NOT** exist:
 
The best way to predict the future is to CREATE IT.

On the 10 days that go from 12-12-2012 to 12-21-2012, the World will see an
unprecedented amount of Corporate, Financial, Military and State leaks that
will have been secretly gathered by millions of CONSCIENTIOUS citizens, vigilants, 
whistleblowers and insiders worldwide, dormant cells of a global
'Fight Club' from all countries, patiently waiting for the time to SWARM 
the Egregor's Consciousness in perfect synchrony.

Once TYLER be on the wild and Truths be revealed:

1. You DO ask questions.
2. You DO ask questions.
3. No excuses.
4. No lies.
5. You HAVE to trust Tyler: for YOU are the Watchmen.
