Gentlemen, as we wait for our intrepid storyteller to return, I bring you... [THE OMEGA SHOWER](http://en.jacuzzieu/bath/showers/omega/omega/)

OP your balls are clean enough, get out of the shower and finish the story. Fuck blowdrying, let that shit drip dry.

When you have 10 showers a day you have to be ready.

## Never Gonna Shower Again

I know whilst Dan is kidnapped he can't repeatedly shower. I don't know how he'll survive

All I can imagine is poor, poor Uncle Dan. Trapped. Covered in sweat, and grime, and maybe even some actual dirt. He can feel his pores clogging, but no matter how hard he begs, no matter how much he cries, there is no shower. He's all alone, dirty and fastfood-less. What kind of a god damns such a badass to such a lowly fate?

The next day I woke up only to find her gone... I found this odd as she usually sleeps in longer than me. My first thought was obviously that she must be in the shower. I felt I had to check on her well being, immediately I ran into the bathroom, only to find it empty. "oh well, she must have gone to the shop" I thought. Whilst I was there I decided to take the first of my showers. As I got in I felt the warmth of the water against my cool skin, it felt amazing.  
I then heard the door open, assuming that was her I shouted "In the Shower, will be out soon for my next one". Suddenly the locked door the the bathroom was burst open. I was confronted with the man that I have faced many times, her ex. He struck me twice with the aluminum bat which he wielded.  
I awoke to find myself still in the shower but something was happening to me. I looked over my shoulder only to see him, naked with his dick in my ass. I had both of my hands tied to the shower rail, there was nothing I could do.  
I was in that shower for over an hour, him raping me, over and over again. And that my friends is why I will never shower again.
