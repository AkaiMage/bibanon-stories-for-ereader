4-ch is the logical successor to world2ch.net in my mind, anyway.  It is a text-only discussion board originally started by squeeks in [November 2004](http://4-ch.net/guide/view/history).  It runs the [[Kareha]] script and is lightly populated.  Feel free to mock the administration savagely on /sports/ because no one will read anything posted there for several months.  Why the fuck even have a sports board?  The posters there don't go outside and even the bright colors of sports on television burn their fragile [[Hikikomori]] eyes...

DQN is their version of News for VIP and stupid things happen there.  The romance and personal issues boards are fucking hilarious.  [[Check it out some time|http://www.4-ch.net]].
