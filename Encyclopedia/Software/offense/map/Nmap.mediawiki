Nmap is a port scanner. It identifies which services are running on a networked computer. This is useful for discovering and identifying points of attack in potential targets. Its ability to scan entire networks is very useful when combined with Whois information about organizations you may be targeting.

The [[GUI]] version of Nmap is called Zenmap.
