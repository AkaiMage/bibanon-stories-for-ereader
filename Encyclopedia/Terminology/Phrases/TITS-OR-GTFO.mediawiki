[[TITS OR GTFO]] (or just '''tits or gtfo''') is commonly seen on [[/b/]] or [[/s/]] in response to pictures of girls that are not showing naked breasts (or nudity in general), indicating that they can choose to show them or GTFO (get the fuck out). Often posted with an image depicting a multiple choice test with two boxes labeled "'''Tits'''" and "'''GTFO'''" with the text "'''The choice is yours'''" accompanying. The same image is also sometimes posted with the "GTFO" box already checked, for subjects found to be boring or unattractive.

This phrase is also number 4 in the [[Rules of the Internet]].

This term was not built out of misogyny, but coined after one too many false [[camwhores]] had teased /b/ and provided nothing. As such, it has become a de facto rule that the supposed girl provide nudes or leave, since "real" women would stay anonymous or avoid [[4chan]] altogether.
