## Masturbating to Yaoi ##

Dear /b/,
I have a problem, I'm so pissed off at myself. It all started 3 hours ago while my girlfriend was taking a shower. She watches alot of anime/hentai and well.. loves it.
What I usually end up doing while she takes a shower is looking at her collection, and masturbating a bit, cause she loves it when she walks back to her room and sees my dick hard.
So I find a picture of some hot girls dressed in a gothic lolita dress and start jacking off. Unfortunately her 40 minutes shower turned to a 10 minute one and she opens the door to find me looking at this.
Now the problem isn't that she saw me masturbating, but the fact that she screamed at me and said "What the fuck are you doing looking at yaoi for?"
Incase you don't know.. yaoi is girl porn. I then told her "What?! I'm not gay" And she says "Those are guys dressed in girl's clothes with make up on!"
She then told me to get dressed and get out of her place. She later texted me telling me "Don't come back here until your a man"
God /b/. why the hell do they make this type of stuff...
OMFG!!!!!!!!!!! Ok I just called her and she hung up. fuck
Heres how it went:
Her: What! Me: Listen baby, I didn't know they were guys. Seriously they look like girls. Her: They are guys (my name). Guys (my name). Why were you masturbating anyway? huh! Me: Baby, I know you love it when I have a hard on after you finish your shower, so I was just looking at the stuff Her: So my body doesn't turn you on anymore is that it?! Me: Wut. no, I'm not saying that! Her: You clearly could have looked at pictures of me on the laptop, but you decide to look at yaoi instead huh? Me: what the hell (hangs up)
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.........................
FUCK!!!!
GAHHHHHHHHHHHH
