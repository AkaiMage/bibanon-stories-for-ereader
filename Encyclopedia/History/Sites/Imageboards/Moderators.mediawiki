=== 4chan mods ===
[[moot]] is the head mod and [[W.T. Snacks]] was his bitch until he was de-modded for reasons which remain unclear. There is also 5, who uses a "rocker" title in blue after his name but claims not to be a mod. They rarely post under their true names, preferring to go under Anonymous##Mod, which is in purple. Mods can also bypass [[wordfilters]] and do a variety of things with the [[futaba]] script, such as post .swf files to embed music.
