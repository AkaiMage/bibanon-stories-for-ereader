Well first of all I reccommend that you read the file on my board about
landmines...  If you can't then here is the concept.

You can use an m-80,h-100, blockbuster or any other type of explosive that
will light with a fuse. Now the way this works is if you have a 9 volt
battery, get either a solar igniter (preferably) or some steel wool you can
create a remote ignition system.  What you do it set up a schematic like this.

     ------------------>+ batery
    steel ||          ->- batery
    wool ||            /
    :==:--- <--fuse    \
     ||                /
     ---- spst switch--\

So when the switch is on the currnet will flow through the steel wool or
igniter and heat up causing the fuse to light.

Note: For use with steel wool try it first and get a really thin piece of
wire and pump the current through it to make sure it will heat up to light the
explosive.

Now the thing to do is plant your explosive wherever you want it to be,bury
it and cover the wires.  Now take a fishing line (about 20 lb. test) and tie
one end to a secure object.  Have your switch secured to something and make a
loop on the other end on the line. Put the loop around the switch such that
when pulled it will pull the switch and set off the explosive.

To ignite the explosive...  The thing to do is to experiment with this and
find your best method...  Let me know on any good kills, or new techniques...

## BOOBY TRAP TRIP WIRES......

_BY Vlad Tepes (of Chgo C64 fame)_

Here is a method for constructing boobytraps which I personally invented,
and which I have found to work better than any other type of release booby
trap.

There are many possible variations on this design, but the basic premise
remains the same. 

## Recipe 

* 3-4 nails each 2 inches long and soft enough to bend easily (galvanized iron works well)
* 6 feet of wire or fishing line
* 5-15 feet of strong string or rope
* 1 really sick mind.

Hammer two of the nails into the trunk of a tree (about one inch apart) so
they form a horizontal line. They should be angled slightly upward, about 30
degrees.

Bend each nail Downward about one inch out from the trunk. Take your
nefarious device (say a small rock suspended in a tree) and rig a rope or
string so the line comes DOWN towards the two nails. Tie a loop in the string
so the loop *just* reaches between the two nails, and pass a third nail
between the two nails with the loop around this nail between the two others
(see diagrams)

          bent nails
         /                        || ^ slight upward tension
    # /\                          ||
    #/                         @  ||    @         ( @ are the two nails, head on)
    #                  ------!----()------
    #          trip wire
     \                     /
    Trunk                 third nail

Now tie one end of the fishing line to the head of the third nail, and the
other end around another tree or to a nail (in another tree, a root or a
stump etc).

When somebody pulls on the trip wire, the nail will be pulled out and your
sick creation will be released to do it's damage (try tying it to a firing
pin).

There are several possible variations. More than one trip wire can be
attached to the same nail, or this device can be used to arm a second trip
wire. Large wire staples or hook and eye loops can be used to replace the two
bent nails.

A more interesting variation uses a straight piece of metal rod with a
hole at each end, or with a short wire loop welded to each end. One end is
attached to the tripwire, the other is attached to a spring.

    */\/\/\/\/\-===()=======--------------------------------------*
      SPRING     BOLT            Trip wire

With this design the loop will be released if the tripwire is pulled or if
it is broken. The spring should be under moderate tension and well oiled.
