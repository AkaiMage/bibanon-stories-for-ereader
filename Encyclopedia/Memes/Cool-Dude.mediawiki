From a [[/b/]] MS Paint relationship thread in which posters used MSPaint stick figure comics to illustrate their relationship problems. The first poster in the thread posted a comic featuring the classic "nice guy" lament in which a nice guy is refused by a female friend who rejects him in favor of an asshole with a better body. The asshole in question, drawn with blocky arms and legs, a crude six-pack abdomen and a goofy-looking grin on his face pointing his fingers at the woman in a "Hey baby, how you doin'?" pose, was quickly [[:Category:Copypasta|copypasta]]'d and photoshopped into numerous other relationship comics in the thread and also began to appear shopped in other pictures as well. Originally known as "Buff Guy", he was rechristened "Cool Dude" and now appears out of nowhere to steal women from other guys. Occasionally he shows a benevolent side, appearing and exhorting wusses to become manly and claim their women, generally by giving them the Obi-Wan-esque command "USE THE POSE, LUKE."
