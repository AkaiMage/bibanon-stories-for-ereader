This is a community-editable report on the shitstorm unleashed by the Zoe Quinn scandal. The scandal has severe implications on the video game journalism industry, and even reveals a troubling insight into the power of forum moderators as gatekeepers of information. 

In response to Zoe Quinn’s false smears about raids against her, and rampant systematic censorship; 4chan’s /v/ and /pol/ , along with other websites (yes, le Reddit) have launched united campaigns to protest the scandal, in a unique new way.

As the situation goes on, we are going to need a solid, well sourced report of all that has happened; it’s truly an unprecedented event in internet history. 

It will also help anons stay up to date without having to ask the thread or read extremely long and dispatriate images.

After this ordeal is over and done, people are going to want to know what happened and why. The wiki should help anyone in the future understand why there was a reform in video game journalism, or why /v/ went to shit, depending on how this all ends.

## Censorship

A few moderators of major forums have deleted any threads relating to the Zoe Quinn incident.

Various reasons could be at play, including white knighting, sincere belief in Zoe's accusations of wrongdoing, anti-spam bots gone wrong, or god knows what.

Whatever the case, this incident has uncovered unsettling cases of heavy handed moderation, and revealed the moderators' unelected power as the gatekeeper of information.

    * Not sure about censorship here, we can never really tell with all the spamming and automatic moderation bots.

### False Reports

*It is important to differentiate the truth from the lies. Even a few misinterpretations will undermine the public’s support. If anything has been confirmed false, post it here.*

* **Alleged YouTube DMCA by Zoe Quinn** - Maybe her, maybe not. Any idiot can launch a DMCA. That’s how screwed up the system is.

    * MundaneMatt claims that it was the same email she uses on other sites [here](http://youtu.be/tJZPzke6fDo?t=2m).

* **/d/ mod -**** **Some moderator of /d/ claimed that Moot instructed the moderation team to "defend" persecuted individuals by deleting threads. This is doubtful, for mods are not board specific. (also needs source)
