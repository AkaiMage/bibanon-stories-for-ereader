> _I know how to MACHINE CODE._

Guides written by various anons on the subject of programming. Surprisingly, the examples might give you a chuckle, just like any typical programming book.

## Programming Languages ##

Here are some programming languages worthy of mention.

* [[Assembly]] - x86's low-level programming language.
* [[C]] - The universal programming language. 
* [[C++|Cpp]] - The universal (object-oriented) programming language.
* [[C Sharp]] - see: [[Java]]
* [[Cobol]] - Nobody uses this.
* [[Java]]
* [[Haskell]] - you have to have four PhD's to be good at haskell
* [[Lisp]]
* [[LOLCODE]] - WHAT IS THIS FAGGOTTREE
* [[Python]] - For quick scripting and easy GUI frontends to C++ programs.
* [[Ruby]]
* [[Visual Basic]] (real men do not program in this)

## Scripting Languages

* [[Bash]] - UNIX-like shell scripting language
* [[Batch]] - Windows command-line scripting language
* [[Javascript]] - The primary scripting language on the internet.
* [[XSS]] - Cross-site scripting: a [[Javascript]]-based exploit.
* [[mIRC Script]] - Great for spamming IRC servers.
* [[Perl]] - Great for messing with text, or stuff on the internet.
* [[Qbasic]]

## Web Development

* [[PHP]] - Most websites use this.
* [[Django]] - A [[Python]]-based website solution.
* [[Ruby on Rails]] - A [[Ruby]]-based website solution.
* [[Node.js]] - A server-based [[Javascript]] website solution.

### Markup Languages

* [[BBCODE]] **_EXPERT BBCODE PROGRAMMERS_**
* [[HTML]] - The primary markup language on the internet.
* [[Markdown]] - A simple but powerful markup language designed for easy editing and reading. It's everywhere, especially on this wiki. Beats typing up HTML.

## So You Want To Learn To Program, eh? ##

Basically, before you start to learn anything, you're going to have to choose what you want to do with your 1337 skills. 

Most universities teach computer science in this order. Therefore, these end up becoming the most common languages, so if you're modding stuff, you should do so too:

* [[Python]] - For quick scripting and easy GUI frontends to C++ programs.
* [[Java]] - For Android apps, existing apps, and an easier way to get comfy with [[C]].
* [[C]] - The universal programming language.
* [[C++|Cpp]] - The universal (object-oriented) programming language.

If you are interested in operating systems/hacking/cracking, then you should follow a path like this:

* [[C]]
* [[C++|Cpp]]
* [[x86 Assembly]]

If you're more interested in web stuff/sploiting things, you should learn everything in the Web Development seciton, along with [[Perl]] or [[Python]] for scripting. 

If you want to make LOL GAEMS then you should just learn [[C++|Cpp]], and if you're a comp sci nerd then [[Haskell]] or [[Lisp]] would be of interest to you.

## Tools ##

Pastebin's are a good way to share your code with other people so that they may give you advice / help debug your code if you are having problems.
