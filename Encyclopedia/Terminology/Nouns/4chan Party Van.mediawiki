=== 4chan Party Van ===
The '''4chan Party Van''' is first seen in a [[MSPaint]] comic. [[Anonymous]] answers his door after the person knocking claims it's the "4chan Party Van", but unfortunately it turns out to be the FBI, who proceed to exclaim "LOL J/K" and beat up Anonymous. 

4chan Party Van is now used as a euphemism for "FBI", often posted during [[CP|child pornography floods]]; became extremely popular after the [[Jake J. Brahm]] incident, where [[/b/]] became aware actual FBI agents might be monitoring their chaos. This newfound knowledge both excites and terrifies many /b/tards.
