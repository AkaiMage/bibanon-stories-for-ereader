Hey guys, making this thread as a continuation to: >>1229527

I have made a screencap of the whole story, which I will upload in a minute. (Too big for 4chan - mediafire)

### 1243862

Just a minute while I have a shower.

"Shower and change... it'll make you feel a bit better, I'll sort you out some bedding."  
"Thats... nostalgic." I thought to myself, closing the door again and heading into the shower"  
"Wouldn't exactly be a lie, even if the rest of it would be, jumping out of the shower I brushed my teeth"  
"Morning" I said without turning around "Go and grab a shower, I've left a towel and some more clothes for you in there, we'll worry about getting yours back later"  
""You hungry? I don't know about you but a shower and some food sound pretty good about now"  
"came back and I jumped in the shower making sure to scrub my face well to get the pig blood off of me"  
"Go ahead and take a shower, at least now you can wear your own pyjamas right?"  
"The next day I got up, showered, dressed and left for work without waking her up"  
"We polished off the pizza and watched TV until 10pm, noticing the news coming on I said "Cmon, you should probably go take a shower now, I'll set up your bed and stuff"  
"I quickly showered expecting her to be up but she was still under than light blue sleeping bag quilting"  
"I pushed the laptop onto the middle seat on top of the empty pizza box and stood up, 'I'm going to go take a shower'"

### 1243937

Shower thread? Awesome!

Seriously though, I've been following this thread since the first post was made, what, 30+ hours ago? Loving every second, very entertaining read. Cant wait for the conclusion.

### 1243998 (Archivist)

\>\>1243937  
Yeah ages, only saw it about 4 hours ago, where I thought it was way, way over...  
Also, britfag here, it's 9pm so he will probably go within a few hours...

I am predicting his story happened about 16 days ago.



## Interlude: Taking a Shower

> _Time passes and Dan has still not returned_

### 1246165

I find the lack of story-telling disturbing

### 1244646

Waiting for Dan to get out of the shower 

### 1246825

If i had eyes that farted and shit I would take 5 showers a day, too

### 1245809

Gentlemen, as we wait for our intrepid storyteller to return, I bring you... [THE OMEGA SHOWER](http://en.jacuzzieu/bath/showers/omega/omega/)

### 1245187

OP your balls are clean enough, get out of the shower and finish the story. Fuck blowdrying, let that shit drip dry.

### 1243998 (Archivist)

\>implying he's not prepared for that problem and has a waterproof laptop
When you have 10 showers a day you have to be ready.

## Never Gonna Shower Again

### 1246282

The fucking small abuser ex has kidnapped Dan, whilst he was in the shower!

### 1246304

\>\>1246282  
DON'T SAY SUCH THINGS `;_;`

### 1246329 (Archivist)

\>\>1246304  
I know whilst Dan is kidnapped he can't repeatedly shower. I don't know how he'll survive

### 1246299 [ ! ] >>1246329

\>\>1246282  
I live in the Midlands too, i'll rescue him! \<spoiler\>let me just take a shower first\</spoiler\>

### 1246383

\>\>1246329  
All I can imagine is poor, poor Uncle Dan. Trapped. Covered in sweat, and grime, and maybe even some actual dirt. He can feel his pores clogging, but no matter how hard he begs, no matter how much he cries, there is no shower. He's all alone, dirty and fastfood-less. What kind of a god damns such a badass to such a lowly fate?

### 1246543 (NOT DAN)

The next day I woke up only to find her gone... I found this odd as she usually sleeps in longer than me. My first thought was obviously that she must be in the shower. I felt I had to check on her well being, immediately I ran into the bathroom, only to find it empty. "oh well, she must have gone to the shop" I thought. Whilst I was there I decided to take the first of my showers. As I got in I felt the warmth of the water against my cool skin, it felt amazing.  
I then heard the door open, assuming that was her I shouted "In the Shower, will be out soon for my next one". Suddenly the locked door the the bathroom was burst open. I was confronted with the man that I have faced many times, her ex. He struck me twice with the aluminum bat which he wielded.  
I awoke to find myself still in the shower but something was happening to me. I looked over my shoulder only to see him, naked with his dick in my ass. I had both of my hands tied to the shower rail, there was nothing I could do.  
I was in that shower for over an hour, him raping me, over and over again. And that my friends is why I will never shower again.  

### 1246594

\>\>1246568

\>implying even that would stop him from taking showers

### 1246598

\>\>1246543  
i laughed  
though dan would've suicided after that, too traumatized to shower? his life would be fucking meaningless

## After-Shower Q&A

### 1243976

Summary of last thread:

>OP gets back with his ex because he's fucking stupid

Summary of this thread:

>They fuck

### 1244006

>He'll probably shower and eat more of Snappy's Pizza again, because his More Than insurance policy leaves him enough money for pizza every Friday

FTFY

### 1244138 (OP)

\>\>1244006  
Funny you should say that, the policy pay-out and statement came through on friday and "2934.96p" was deposited into my account along with the index prices of everything that was covered... all in all I only paid about 1300 for everything in my apartment originally, most of it was from ebay or stuff people were getting rid of when I moved in and needed things.

I'm probably going to replace everything via ebay and other cheap sites to save as much money as possible again and then use the rest for pizza/beer/curry money.

... maybe buy a new \<spoiler\>shower\</spoiler\>... all this talk of showers is really making me want to go and have a shower. 

### 1244426 (OP)

\>\>1244410  
> Hey OP  
> so why did your ex (Betty I assume) tell the guy where you lived?  
> as a forever alone i am really enjoying the story  
    
Betty is her mothers name, he described me to her and she gave him my name, then he looked me up as it turns out.

And thanks again everyone for following the story! hope you're finding it sufficiently cool!

### 1248734

After reading all of the story posted so far.. seeing that he has quite the active life and is pretty damn alpha... I have to ask.. How the fuck did he end up on /r9k/ for 18 hours a day?

### 1248794

\>\>1248734  
probably has a waterproof smartphone and uses it to enter 4chan while showering

### 1252198 (OP)

>>1248734
lol notice the long gaps between my posts? I'm usually up to something when that happens, eating, drinking, having a shower, going for a jog, lifting weights etc, I'm quite a solitary man and I don't have many hobbies, I don't even own an xbox or ps3, I had a wii but I got drunk one night and my leg caught around the power cable sending it flying off my set top box on the wall and smashing on the floor, I actually claimed it on the insurance heheh, I'm covered for accidental damage anyway but I just never got round to it until last week, can't wait to play me some Wii Sports and thee new Zelda: Skyward Sword, I'm actually a mega-huge zelda fag, final fantasy too but not owning a ps3 means not being able to play, from what I've read FF13 was a complete farce anyway and much worse than 12 so I'm not too bothered about playing it, if someone put a gun to my head and screamed "WHATS YOUR FAVORITE GAME!" I'd have to say Link To The Past, I played it on an emulator a year ago and to my surprise I hadn't forgotten a single thing about it and blew through it in less than 5 hours.

Just got out of the shower, for the sake of you guys I timed myself and it seems I take around an hour in there from start to finish, a lot of time is eaten up working on my hair and deep cleansing then moisturizing my face, gotta keep those boyish good looks!

### 1252877

Fucking dan's back. Holy fuck you started posting at 11ish, and thats after you've showered, worked out, eaten, etc. 

I've only just fucking got up at 1pm and have only showered...

You're making me look bad...

### 1252268

OP, you have to have some sort of ocd or something to spend an hour showering each time

### 1252328

\>\>1252306  

\>[The fact] that it takes him an hour is what makes think that [he can't possibly be taking like, what,] 15 a day?

not strange to me anymore, ever since OP started this story i have been taking 40 showers a day

### 1252332

\>\>1252328  
One must wonder, at that level, why even bother getting out?

### 1252523 (OP)

Will post in a sec, just farting into the shower.

## 1244327 (OP)

She had gone into the livingroom, I spread out on my bed, I'd never been much of a jazz guy but whatever the Tune-In app had selected on my phone felt... appropreate, easy listening, smooth jazz... I lay there with my eyes shit following the gentle beat and the rhytm of the sax with my mind, trying to keep my mind off of everything because it was pointless to think about, after quite a while, maybe 10 minutes or so I could feel myself drifting... then I heard shuffling from livingroom, then the familiar shuffle of one small blonde girl shuffling around, I saw the bathroom light go on, and a few moments later go off again, then I heard a whisper through my door, "Daniel" she said quietly "... are you awake?", I remained silent hoping that she would shuffle away back into the livingroom, and eventually she did, my relief was short-lived though as she shuffling soon made it's way back towards my door, this time gently turning the handle of my door and popping it open, I kept my eyes shut hoping that she would use her better judgement and not disturb me but no such luck, the shuffle came ever closer towards my bed and stopped, then I felt the matress press down as she took a place next to me... "I can't tell if she's too scared to sleep alone after today or just hates sleeping on those sofas" I thought as I felt that winter warmer flop over my side "Can't decide whether I should eject her either... she did have a rough day--" My thoughts were halted as a hand as cold as a can of beer touched by abs and my muscles contracted to counter the sensation. "Are you awake Dan?" I heard her whisper softly

"Fucking well am now" I thought as I sighed

### 1244685 (OP)

"Too cold in the living room?" I said as I put my hands over my face, running them through my hair and spreading them out over the bed, "No..."  
"Then why are you here?"  
I felt her tense up as I asked the question, curling up next to me, there was a small pause, then she shyly said "I don't want to be by myself..."  
"I thought as much... well you should probably get inside the sheets in that case..."  
The hand she put across me abs moved up on to my chest as she shuffled upwards on the bed, her hair touching my arm as she re-settled, "... Can I stay here?"  
"... Are you scared of being in the livingroom?"  
"... Yes..."  
"... Get inside the sheets then"  
"Will you?"  
"Nah, I never sleep inside the sheets you know that..."  
"... Can I stay here?"  

## 1244864 (OP)

I wasn't in the mood to protest, so I folded my arm around her and said "Don't make a habit of it", she took my arm and did the hug pillow thing, folding her arms and curling her legs around it, it wasn't uncomfortable and even if it was I was way too tired to care, beating people up and having adrenaline running through you really takes it out of you no matter what shape you're in, just for fun I tugged my arm and made an "arrghh" sound jokingly, she uttered like the sound a child makes when you try and take something off of it and hugged my arm tighter, I smiled, then I curved my hand around and used my fingers to tickle her stomach, she squirmed and made that sound again, then I grabbed the hem of her PJ bottoms and slid my hand inside slowly waiting for her to react, as I began to tickle she took her hand, fished my hand out of her bottoms and held it with our hands clasped, "Perv..." she said in a sleepy tone before re-adjusting and settling down again, amused I took a deep breath and let out a loud yawn, and within a few moments I fell asleep...

## 1252204 (OP)

I woke up around 5 and noticed she had shifted around in the bed a little, her awkward sleeping position had strangled the arm she was clinging onto causing me to loose feeling in it, so much so I could barely move it at all... "Nostalgic" I thought as I remembered the scene from Kill Bill "Wiggle your big toe" I smiled as I struggled to move my fingers and get the blood pumping around my arm again, with a little patience the feeling came back and the pins and needles were unreal, so I slowly slid my arm out of her death grip, gentle and slow, trying not to wake her, and once it was out I picked myself up off the bed, "Did it have to be my smoking arm?" I thought to myself, the arm still pretty much useless for the hours of near suffocation she had put it through, I grabbed my cigarettes and popped out out into my mouth, then grabbed my lighter and walked out of the room and into the livingroom to my still-playing laptop and then sat down on the colder-than-cold leather sofa that sent a shiver up my spine as I sat back into it "Saturday..." I thought to myself as I was loading up BBC News "Today I'd usually masturbate, take a shower, do my skincare thing and spend the rest of the day at the reservoir jogging and loafing"

## 1252211 (OP)

Reading the news about the economy is one of those necessary evils you have to do as you get older, you know you can't do shit about it but it's only right you know and it gives you something to talk about at work, normally I'd just put the TV on and switch over to BBC News 24 but, looking across the room at the fucked up TV that wasn't really an option, after reading I loaded up kerrang on low and went to make some coffee, quickly realizing that it was on the casualty list I opted for some orange juice instead and left the glass on the counter before sneaking back into my room and picking out a pair of green cargos and a black sleeveless hoodie to counter the coldness of the sofa, picking up the juice I went back into the livingroom, lit the cigarette and instead of questing for porn as I normally would I just sat back and enjoyed the tunes and fumes, after that was done I took the peace and quiet as an opportunity to fill out the claim form online, as my ipod was unscathed in the attack I connected it up with my laptop and enjoyed, before long a small figure came walking in rubbing her eyes, "Goodmorning Daniel, Whats that?" She said as she flopped down onto the sofa next to me, "Claims form" I said as she took the arm she had been suffocating all night and wrapped it around her shoulders, "Best to get this sorted as soon as possible, I only have 48 hours to make the claim", she said nothing for a while and just watched as I filled in the list of things that were taken and broken (even if the ring, locket, watch and money were back in my possession, it had to be consistent with the police report), She watched as I filled in a spreadsheet of every item involved, then looked up at me as I saved the file and looked down at her.

## 1252217 (OP)

"Oh Daniel..." She said sleepily, breaking out of a yawn, "You have to be the only person I know who wouldn't be freaking out about something like this... If this was my place I think I'd have had a nervous breakdown when I walked in"

"Yeah, well, dad always said to take life how it comes and not to bother worrying about the little things..."

She gestured he head at the pile of broken items piled up at the back of the room, "All of this is a little thing?"

"They're just things... Big things are things like life, death, love, prosperity, family and all that stuff that has no cash value."

"... Thanks for not getting mad about this."

"Why would I be mad? I'm looking on the bright side... Might even be able to afford a few extra things with the policy money, the only thing I'm pissed about is my coffee table. I fucking loved that thing and I'm sure they don't make them anymore" She smiled and waiting for a moment, then sat up and said "Close your eyes for me"

"... why?"

"C'mon, just do it... please?"

### 1252224 (OP)

I closed my eyes expecting her to go and get something, instead she shifted her leg around to sit on my lap facing me and covering my eyes with her hands she leaned down and kissed me, keeping it for a long as possible and putting her arms around my shoulders, I leaned back on the sofa as a rush of good feelings washed over me and put my arms around her hips to hold her close, after a moment she broke the kiss, "I've been wanting to do that since you first let me in here... you're not mad are you?" I thought for a second staring into her eyes, then smiled and said "I don't know... hard to make that kind of decision with just one kiss", she fluttered her eyes and smiled as I took her head and lay her down to my side over the couch, pressing my lips against hers, her wrapped her arms around my neck and her legs around my waist as we lay there, moments later she looked up at me smiling and said "What now...?" I smiled and picked her up, looking down at her in my arms, her smiling back and biting her lip, the bedroom was still fairly dark as I placed her on the bed and took my hoodie off, her unbuttoning her classy pyjamas as I reached into my bedside cabinet to put something on the end of it, then I peeled the sheets back, picked her up again and put her down as I folded the sheets over us and through mutual cooperation along side some heavy petting my cargos, her PJ bottoms and our underwear were thrown out of the bed as we got low.

### 1252318

Oh man he's gonna [have to take a] shower after sex

## 1252553 (OP)

We were at it for 3 hours straight, 7 years without a woman and a week without a wank gives you more than an average sexual appetite, on the last fold we were both drenched in sweat, her brow glistening in the early light as she rode hard on top of me, her muffled moans and gasps getting more intense as she shut her eyes tight, I grabbed her hips and thrust into her hard on the last stretch, keeping rhythm with her I rose my abs up and she shook hard, clenching her teeth before letting out one last loud gasp as I shot my load inside of her, then she flopped down onto my chest using her arms to break her fall, then bought her hands into mine that I'd stretched out over the bed and clasped them gently, panting on top of me as I tried to to control my breathing, I brushed her hair out of her face and back towards her body and bought my arms around to embrace her, holding her close on top of me, there we lay for a while enjoying the moment as our breathing steadied... I looked down and she was fast asleep on top of me, her hands around my sides... "Amazing" I thought to myself "7 years and still she can take it out of me...", my mind wandered and I found myself questioning what the relationship between us was after such a thing, or how she would react when after something like that I still felt the same way as I did when she first barged back in to my life... you can't wave a pussy infront of me and expect 7 years of pain and struggle to be forgotten, plus she owed me for all the trouble I'd put myself through over the past few days... "maybe owe is a bad word for it" I thought to myself, closing my eyes and running my hands along her back and down to her ass... "But then again, I didn't do what I did for that either... I did it because it was the right thing to do... and he smashed up my place..." I lifted up the sheet and examined her body again like I did the few nights before... all those cuts, grazes and bruises all over her body...

## 1252563 (OP)

Fresh ones from the previous day were there too... when she was on top of me I noticed a fresh black bruise on her stomach, thinking about it now he must have hit her pretty hard, more than enough to knock the wind out of her, I gritted my teeth at the thought and held her close to me, "I'm glad I did what I did... and I meant every word I said... I'd have killed him if she wasn't there to step me, nobody should have to go through that..." I thought about other things too, like how could she go from the girl who managed to make a complete fool out of me all those years ago to being stuck with a fat deadbeat like that... for a moment I felt sick, "How insulting" I thought to myself, thinking about how she could go from me to him, I mean come on, she could have at least traded up... then I remembered that life seldom goes the way you wanted to, and to have taken that road she must have been pretty desperate... she had to have lost everything because what she took from that place was almost nothing... then again look at her loser mother, look at the way she was raised... she was always pretty cut throat and I admired that strength, only 7 years later I could see what it was, it wasn't strength at all...

It was desperation.

## 1252691 (OP)

She was always hellbent on obtaining things, working every hour god sent, being very careful with her money, saving up to buy expensive clothes and dressing formally all of the time... the trademark of a person who has nothing... the only "poor person" clothes she had were my old t-shirts and you could never get here to wear a beanie or baseball cap or anything, my little sister used to call her "The ghetto snob", it was about right... she couldn't embrace who she was then, always fighting with the way she was bought up, if you heard her mother speak you wouldn't believe she came from her at all, they were worlds apart and her mother hated my guts because she saw me as a threat to her daughters otherwise complete loyalty to me... in the end her mother won out, her loyalty to me was the first to go, then her respect... you never see those changes when you're in love with someone, you want to believe that they love you just as much as you love them, and I never saw it coming... the day I came home from work with all of her objectives met, my boxes in front of the door as she coldly demanded I take them and get out... just remembering that feeling made me extremely angry, almost enough to push her off of me, the hell I had to go through to get back on my feet after she had taken everything, drained my accounts and fooled my parents into giving her the money for a car promising to pay them back a few hundred a month... it wasn't the money she took, so much as the trust she broke, along with my self-esteem, my plans for the future which all revolved around her and worst of all my ability to love, and possibly my innocent view of the world...

## 

7 years later, 7 years wiser, and 7 years of change.... While I worked hard to make a good life for myself, get a decent place and start working towards a better future, constantly investing into myself in every aspect I could, she had walked the path of greed, lies and self destruction... and for some reason, forced or otherwise our paths had crossed again, "What'll you do now?" I thought to myself as I gently rolled her off my and pulled the sheets over her, peeling the condom off my dick and throwing it into the wicker bin, I briefly entertained the thought of throwing her out, smiling I shook my head, walking around the bed, "Nah, you're not that type of man, plus she still has a lot to make up for...I walked into the bathroom and started the shower, jumping in as the water got warm enough and going straight for the dove body cleanser, I decided to make it a quick one, just to wash the sweat and sex juice off me, as I stood with my palms against the tiles I caught myself thinking about her, wondering if I ever could give her a second chance... my mind scoured it's archives looking for any instance I'd encountered where someone redeemed themselves after fucking up so badly, I decided as a show of good faith and my placing a bit of faith in her, instead of calling her by her name, a name that made me cringe at the mear thought of it, I'd give her a new one, it was silly and childish but hey, if it worked it might encourage her, and it's not like I had anything to lose... Instantly I came to Akon, I laughed to myself... that would stick out way too much and she would probably catch on if she thought about it too much...

Still thinking the shower curtain opened and there stood the tiny naked blonde, looking a little groggy with her deshevilled sex hair, "You know, you're supposed to stop in bed after sex, it's the rules Daniel..." I stood staring at her, taking my hands off the wall as I'm sure it looks weird to anyone watching, I turned to face her and flicked some water at her, "Oi!" she said, rubbing arms with her hands "Cold!", I stood silent for a moment before offering my hand and saying "Cmon, waters warm, after all that I don't think I really have to not let you see me naked anymore, she hesitated before taking my hand and carefully stepping in behind me, , I took the shower head off the holder and handed her the body wash before reaching around her and rinsing her head to toe, she lathered up and as I washed the remainder of the suds off of me and handed her the shower head, she grabbed my arm and said "Please stay..."
"Alright, but if I get hard we're ignoring it, my electric bill is going to be insane if this carries on", she smiled as she took the shampoo and worked it through her hair, turning to me and gesturing for me to help her rinse with a smile on her face, "Should we talk about it?" she said, facing away as I rinsed her hair, "About what?"
"... The reason we're both standing here..."
"If you want to, I've actually been giving it some thought..."
"... So what do you think we should do now?" she said, turning to face me as I handed the shower head back, "Well, I think it would be a massive mistake to put a label on anything right now... maybe just take it as it comes, theres still a lot that needs to be worked out before we even think about that kind of thing",

"Britt..." I said, lightly tapping the tip of her nose with my finger
"Britt?"
"Yeah Britt... What do you think?"
"... what do you mean?"
"Well you know out on the balcony you asked if I'd ever call you by your name? Well how does a fresh one sound? It's a massive step up from using things like "Hey" or "You" and I thought it might put you at ease... I still don't like saying your given name, but--"
"Okay... Britt" she smiled and nodded, "I can live with that..."
"I meant it as just for something I'd call you, y'know, like a nickname..."
She smiled and put her arms around my waist, "Britt..." I heard her say softly, "Thanks Daniel... for everything, I promise I won't let you down..." She looked up into my eyes and said "If it takes me years, I'll show you I'm not the same person I was back then... With a little luck, I'll be able to get you to open up to me one day", and with that she squeezed my wait with her arms, and after a brief moment of silence, we went into the bedroom, dried off, had some breakfast and set off to the reservoir...

... So thats pretty much the cool story of how that tueday night a blond girl rushed into my apartment and Britt came back in to my life... I still don't know if letting her back in is such a good idea, only time will tell, maybe a few months down the line we can do this again and I'll call it "Cool Story 2: On the lamb, murder suspect at large", sleeping in a high school sports closet all day and eating Snappy Tomato Pizza and posting what happened at night, in the last week I convinced Britt to come with me to her mothers house, there I called betty a huge cunt and told her what happened, then showed her the bruises all over Britts body, she showed no remorse and said it was her own fault and I flipped out and took Britt home.

She also came with me to my parents house on tuesday and I acted in her defense as she nervously pleaded her case to my mother, brother, father and sister... she handed a small part of the money she owed back to my father and promised to pay them back, my parents have respected my wishes and given her another chance, my little sister made her cry when I was talking to my parents alone, telling her all the shit I went through, she also said some pretty harsh shit to her afterwards, stuff that I'd probably never could have bought myself to say to her, she felt so bad about it she had an emotional outburst and cried herself to sleep that night.

She's told her friends what happened but not told them that she's living with me, instead she said she's "Staying with an old friend" and told them to stay away from her ex, I trust nothing will come of it seeing as how I left him trembling in a pool of his own blood last time he saw me and threatened to torture him if I so much as saw him walking down the street, he won't want anything to do with her or her friends... if he's got any brains at all he won't test my patience again, seeing as how last time I could and would have beaten him to death and/or roasted him alive.

I hope you guys enjoyed the story... I wish you guys could take away some kind of deeper meaning or moral but I honestly can't think of any, this was all just some "Day in the life" shit I thought you guys would enjoy reading as much as I enjoyed living it... maybe one thing you can take away from it all is that showers are actually quite magical, they clean you up, they wash off evidence of asskickery/badassery and pizza sauce, they give you a much needed place and time to think about the important things in life and they're actually kind of romantic and a bit of a teamwork builder if you share one, heheh.

I hope you found this to be a cool story. I don't know about you guys but all this typing has really made me sticky, I'm going to grab a nice hot shower, it's been real, thanks for reading and I hope every time you shower, smoke a cigarette, eat a pizza or kick the shit out of a fat deadbeat you'll think of me.
