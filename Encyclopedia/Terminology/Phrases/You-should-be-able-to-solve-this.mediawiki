[[/a/]] meme from the anime ''Pretty Cure'' depicting an annoyed teacher demanding his lazy class to solve a math problem, unaware of the fact that the problem he wrote was impossible. The "solution" to the problem would be the laughable result of "0 = 26", which could only make sense in a universe where [[Dividing by Zero]] is possible. Often used to sarcastically jab at Japan's tendency to showcase real world mathematics or words in foreign languages, only to pronounce/spell something wrong. Frequently a subject of shopping, where the offending equation is replaced with an either more complex/obvious but very solvable problem.
