You could either say "figgis-fiddis" or "F-G-S-F-D-S", but however you say it, it is the one word that makes no sense whatsoever at all. It started when an [[anonymous]] replied to a post on [[4chan]] with "fgsfds". A [[namefag]], Oryan, then shopped the phrase into a [[pic]] of German talk-show presenter Harald Schmidt.

When somebody confuses you by saying something that makes no sense, simply say "fgsfds".

'''fgsfds''' is commonly [[photoshopped]] onto pictures of anyone pointing their index finger in the air.

==Origins==

The term probably came from [[Something Awful]], imported into [[4chan]] during one of their mass migrations. It's original meaning was likely an acronym for "For God's Sake Fuck Dis Shit", though it was long forgotten by then.
