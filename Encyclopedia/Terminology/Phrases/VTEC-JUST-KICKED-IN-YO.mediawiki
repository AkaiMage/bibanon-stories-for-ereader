[[VTEC JUST KICKED IN YO]] first appeared on [[/p/]] in response to a picture of a Honda. VTEC refers to Honda's variable valve timing system, which is used to increase horsepower at higher RPMs. Since many /p/ regulars didn't think highly of VTEC, this expression was used to negatively describe any highly modified Asian car (aka a [[ricer]]).

This meme was given new life thanks to the unfortunately named [[VTech Massacre]] which occurred on April 16, 2007.
