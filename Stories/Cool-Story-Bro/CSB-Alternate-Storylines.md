# CSB Alternate Storylines

A series of posts made by anons to troll other users. Some of them even became interesting alternative fanfiction in their own right.

## Cool Story Bro: "Fuck me. Literally."

Starts from OP's post `1229976`. Daniel's famous last words are, "Fuck me." But anons imagine an alternate world where the girl takes it literally.

At this moment, I didn't know what to do... I had been thinking about it, for what felt like hours. I still couldn't decide whether I was going to show any remorse or not.

I sat down on the couch that had been turned into a temporary bed, not making eye contact with her, I sighed, not knowing what to do.. Before I could act or even think of something to say I felt her soft, shaking hand slowly caress my lower back, I looked her in the eye and all I could see was pain and regret. She started moving her body closer to mine, with small, subtle movements. She then looked up at me and said "I need you right now, I'm sorry for what I did, but I've always liked you... And you're all I have at the moment" What was she doing? What was she thinking?

## Cool Story Bro: The Jumper

In this storyline, the girl attempts to kill herself. It starts from OP's post 1230093 in the actual story.

Eventually, the OP had to use a tripcode to keep up his story:

> Ghost writer has made it hard to read this thread, but it should be easy enough to follow my style of writing, life is not nearly as dramatic as this guys fantasies unfortunately, although from the gist of his posts it would have made for a pretty cool story too. ill be using this trip from now on.

Then she spoke up. "I'm sorry for leaving you so soon. I knew that I shouldn't have left you for that jerk!" I turned to look at her, and I saw she was still crying. Our eyes met for a while, but she quickly averted my gaze. She put her glass down on the coffee table, and stopped crying for a while. "Oh God, oh God, could you ever forgive me for treating you like such a jerk?" She sobbed. "I'll never be the same as I was. How could I ever left you?" She started to hit her head on the armrest of the sofa-bed. I quickly stopped her. "No," she sobbed. "It's too late, I tell you." Suddenly she leapt out of the bed and made a dash to the balcony. I quickly stopped her. "What do you think you are doing?" I hissed. She looked forlorn. "I'm so sorry I left you. And I feel that only my death would show how sorry I am for leaving you!" I panicked. What would I do? I definitely couldn't let her die like that; I'd get in trouble with the cops. I tried to calm her down.

But she kept lunging for the balcony. I begged for her to stop, but she kept lunging for the balcony. Down below, the lights of the city shone brightly, as though tempting me to let go. I was about to release when she suddenly fell down limp to the floor, sobbing. "I can't do this! Not for you, not for me, not for the baby in me!" I let go in shock. Baby? What baby? She definitely wasn't showing any signs of pregnancy. "I'm sorry. The other day, I checked. I was pregnant. And was I so happy! But that jerk just had to ruin it. First he used it to prevent me seeing my friends, then going out to shop, and finally to even leave the house! He told me that if I ever left him, he would make sure that I would end up penniless and on the street with a baby. And what could I do? He had all the money, heck, even the house I lived in!" She broke into tears again. I could only stare at her.

"So, what'd you want me to do then? Take you back in?" She nodded. I looked around my cramped apartment. There was only a bedroom, kitchen, living room and a spare room that I used for storage and the like. It was small, but that was the bare minimum I could manage as a struggling writer in the middle of Chicago. "I...I don't think I can ever manage to take you in. There's just not enough room for the both of us. And besides, I'm already struggling to pay the bills here. I sure as hell can't manage to feed you, unless you start doing sonme decent work. She stared at me. "What? Are you throwing me out into the streets? When it's still in the middle of winter? I'll freeze to death." I sighed. Now was I going to let a girl who had once broken my heart and stomped on the pieces back into my life? Or was I going to let her die a pauper, cold and frozen in the streets the way I had always hoped she would turn out? My cold heart for her was already beginning to warm with the fires of compassion. I definitely couldn't let her down, but then...

She turned to face me in a huff, but then one glance at my unmoved face revealed that I was serious. "So...you mean that if you want me back in I'll have to work?" I nodded. "Sorry. No free rides, girl." She sobbed. "Fine, then. I'll leave you in your sorry old apartment, and don't be sorry if you ever happen to see me dead in the snow!" With that, she turned around and stormed out of the apartment and slammed the door for a moment. I couldn't help but shed a tear at her plight. I glanced at her half-drunk cup of tea. I just couldn't bring to pour it out. I just glanced at it, imagining her sorry shape still lying on the sofa. With a deep sigh, I walked over to the door and peeped out in case she was still there. But the corridor was empty. There was no trace of her. She had gone with the frigid January wind.

The next day I was walking over to the nearby K Mart to buy some groceries. I hugged my windbreaker tightly against me to insulate me from the cold when I saw a familiar figure lying in a snowdrift. It was her. She seemed blue. I quickly ran towards her to feel her pulse. It was faint and weak. Suddenly her eyes flickered open. "What...what are you doing here? Are you trying to finish me off?" She staggered to her feet, shivering continuously due to the extreme cold. I immediately felt a twinge of pity for her, but struggled to hide my feelings from her. She didn't want her the other day. I swallowed my feelings. Of course her boyfriend was always a jerk, but could I ever afford to take her back? She was poor, penniless, and soon I would have to end up paying for a third soul which was never mine in the first place. It was too big a gamble, too big to risk my reputation for. Heck, if her boyfriend called the cops, my dream would be ruined. Forever. I mulled this over. But then, could I ever live with my conscience if she died as I did nothing?

"Please, please just bring me home. I'll do anything for you!" I pondered her offer. Somehow her white, shivering knuckles and her poor, emaciated state started to warm my heart. But what use was there for me to bring her home if all she was going to do was to strain my finances waiting for the next perfect boyfriend to come along? I made up my mind. "Come." I led her to the K Mart that I was going to anyway. I pulled out a crisp 20 dollar note from my wallet. Spend it however you like. I'll do my own shopping while you do yours. Meet me when you're done at this same spot. I knew 20 dollars was a lot for me, but then I couldn't let her die. Besides, I was planning to test her, to see whether she had still kept her crazy spending habits. It was a gamble for me, and for her too. After I made sure she was out of my sight, I walked over and bought a box of ramen. And returned to my corner. Waiting for her. Would she bail on me? Would she return? Would she still be the same? People kept giving me odd looks as I stood there, looking like a fool. And so I waited, glancing at my watch.

Five minutes passed. And then ten. Then fifteen. And a cashier actually walked from his spot to tell me that I was blocking to the exit. Finally thirty minutes passed, and she reappeared, looking warmer and healthier than when I first found her. She was checking out a decent jacket that would at least protect her from the cold. I winked at her; she winked back. Purchases done, she walked over to me. "You know, I was quite tempted to bail and spend my money on some drugs. But then I thought of you, and how bad you must feel for me self-flagellating myself. I managed a soft smile. How could I have been so cruel to her? Then as I was basking in the warm glow of her accepting me, she suddenly asked me, "So, does that mean I can come back with you?" My heart welled with pity for her once more. With a half hearted sigh, I demurred. Her face instantly lit up and she squealed with delight. "Yaay! Let's go now!" I glared at her. People were already starting to stare at us. She noticed and immediately quietened down. I broke the tension. "Let's... just walk home." So the both of us began the long walk home, in the face of the chill wind. She kept close to me all the while. We reached my apartment after a while. And entered. Together. After all these years.
