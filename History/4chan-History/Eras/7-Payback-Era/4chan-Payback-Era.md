_(2010-2011)_

After most anons forgot or gave up on Chanology, they returned to normal business on 4chan, which was still slowly growing in popularity. However, with the chilling news that Aiplex Software was DDoSing torrent sites for the MPAA, [[Anonymous]] came right out of dormancy to start a new age of hacktivism that grew to include [[Wikileaks]] and the [[Arab Spring]]. 4chan finally disowns Anonymous and it's related entities for good, and it is commonly accepted that Anonymous no longer lurks on 4chan.
