Oregon-girl began posting on [[/b/]] in August of '07. Her name came from her first post when she stated that "Oregon girls have no face." She gave her AIM (stella tetra) out, and has been plagued with /b/tards ever since. OG has continued to post on /b/ throughout her camwhoring career, but sometimes goes missing for months at a time.

Oregon-girl has stated that she in 12 in several AIM conversations, but this is highly unlikely and probably just to throw Anon off.
