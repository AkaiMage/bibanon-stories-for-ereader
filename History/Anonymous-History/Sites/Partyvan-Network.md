The Partyvan Network was an early coalition of anons who were instrumental in Anonymous's raids, and creating a more organized network outside of the distractions, the mods, and the sudden thrills of 4chan.

(This page is a mess, and we need more info about them. Need some help here.)

## As told by januszeal
Origin of partyvan irc.

   * I'm not 100% sure of the order these events 

1. januszeal and Anima got bored, created helldive irc.
2. Got a bunch of users from Bantown IRC during the days that weev glined every major ISP.
3. Linked with wtfux
4. Linked with Raidchan (oldfag note - #insurgency moved from EFnet to partyvan at this point)
5. Linked with partyvan.org - At somepoint the network was renamed to lulznet
6. Anima quit irc 4lyfe
7. Linked with 7chan
8. Caturday Nap - GOOD JOB kakama + januszeal + trapdoor, internet superheros - Network is renamed to partyvan
9. 7chan link died due to massive abuse from opers, trapdoor ddoses the entire country of .au to stop it
10. Raidchan split. Don't remember why
11. wtfux splits.
12. cacaw irc is created, <strike>2</strike> OVER 9000 users leave pv
13. Great oper purge of 2008

(go on... What about insurgen.cc?)

## Backstory ##

helldive/partyvan story from Xmas 09
--[VanKrause](User:VanKrause) 21:54, 27 April 2010 (UTC)
<pre>
(20:38) <jz|laptop>here is a story
(20:38) <jz|laptop>about how
(20:38) <jz|laptop>the internet
(20:38) <jz|laptop>got flipped turned upside down
(20:39) <jz|laptop>so just sit right there
(20:39) <jz|laptop>i'll tell you how this irc became 
(20:39) <jz|laptop>something
(20:39) <jz|laptop>way back in the day i chilled on ED IRC
(20:39) <jz|laptop>then irc.bantown.com
(20:39) <jz|laptop>and i made a channel
(20:39) <jz|laptop>and ajt didn't give me oper
(20:39) <jz|laptop>so i made a network of my own
(20:39) <jz|laptop>with my bro inari
(20:39) <jz|laptop>and called it irc.helldive.net
(20:40) <jz|laptop>we gre
(20:40) <jz|laptop>grew
(20:40) <jz|laptop>and grew
(20:40) <jz|laptop>and growed more
(20:40) <jz|laptop>and then we linked with jihad's network 
(20:40) <jz|laptop>wtfux
(20:41) <jz|laptop>and the network was renamed to lulznet
(20:41) <jz|laptop>and #insurgency moved from efnet
(20:41) <jz|laptop>and we linked with raidchan
(20:41) <jz|laptop>and then we grew to like 500 users
(20:41) <jz|laptop>and then xenu happened
(20:41) <jz|laptop>711chan
(20:41) <jz|laptop>joined
(20:41) <jz|laptop>we renamed to partyvan
(20:41) <jz|laptop>there were like 4000 users every day
(20:42) <jz|laptop>along the way wtfux left
(20:42) <jz|laptop>due to lolinternet
(20:42) <jz|laptop>raidchan was delinked after i ddosed the entire country of .au offline
(20:42) <jz|laptop>because they were operabusing cunts
(20:43) <Kakama>from your perspective it was helldrive
(20:43) <Kakama>dive
(20:43) <Kakama>and from the perspective of all those other people, stories intertwine
(20:43) <jz|laptop>what was helldive
(20:43) <jz|laptop>no here is why i say raidchan etc joined helldive
(20:44) <jz|laptop>and not the other way around
(20:44) <jz|laptop>because i was always in control of the bigger network
(20:44) <AlecVanKrause>then there was the whole kakama/caturday nap thing with 4chan & rizon
(20:44) <jz|laptop>smaller irc linked to larger network
(20:44) <jz|laptop>AlecVanKrause: that was right before raidchan delinked

## Smattering of information by NekoArc ##

<pre>* madclown changes topic to 'made neko an oper hope thats ok , if not cocks ect.. | 
leave my glines there, they were for attempted blackmail of an ircop they are lucky im not pressing charges | 
get this `bopm' pig off my server'</pre>

In late November, [NekoArc](User:NekoArc) was added on as an oper to the Atlantis leaf of the network. At that time, there was the main server, Atlantis, Love, and Gorf. Around that time, people were harassing Artix over being a drama whore, and BLACK_MAN and the BMC made their appearance, compromising several channels and packeting the network into oblivion (causing a few servers to permanently delink).
Around mid-December, there was talk about bringing up a mirror of Partyvan up, so as you can see, getting this shit going was in the works for quite a while. On December 20th, wtfux relinked with helldive. When that happened, for several days people flooded #wtfux in protest. Logs would be posted, but that would probably fill several books worth. In very late December, 03chan linked to minor success at the time
A few weeks later, that leaf was removed as the 03chan admins are whiny faggots. On Jan 21st or so, there was some operdrama and Atlantis was juped from the network. Meanwhile, SeanieB joined the network and brought on his server. Since Atlantis left, NekoArc added Tsuki onto the network during that time. Shitdive still gay n fuck opers
