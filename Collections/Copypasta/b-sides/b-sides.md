This is a collection of stories written by /b/, where writers, 
after looking at some strange pictures, decided to write up a 
side story behind them. 

This entire archive would have been lost in it's entirety if not 
for the efforts of Sarafan, a major sysop of Wikichan who posted 
his entire dump of their most important articles (including 
the original Nurse-Kun threads) on Megaupload before the wiki 
shut down for good. Unfortunately, with Megaupload itself being

## Stories

I remember the first time we met... with a starry sky against a 
romantic twilight. He seemed so rugged and so strong as he foiled 
a plot by Megatron to steal the world's cows to make into energon 
cubes, or something... and when his blue glowing eyes fell upon 
me after the battle I was drawn to him.He was a robot that turned 
into a truck, and I was a normal human that just happened to be registered 
mechanic. Two different worlds with one common interest.The 
rest of the night I explored his joints, and changed his oils. 
So wrapped up in passion were we that Optimus couldn't pull out 
in time... it didn't matter anyway, he was low on brake fluid.He 
left that morning with Jazz and Bumblebee, and every night when 
the sky is clear I look down the road, remembering that for some 
reason only Decepticons could fly.One day Optimus, I would like 
you to return to meet your daughter. Her name is Vespa. 

The hand that held the gun fell to my side limply, as the enormity 
of what I'd just done sank in. The little girl's body wavered where 
she stood, her one eye staring accusingly at me as her body toppled 
to the floor backwards, almost like a knocked out boxer.Blood 
pooled at my feet, but it didn't matter since her blood soaked 
my shirt, marking me for my sin. I fought back the urge to vomit, 
and I slumped back against the door-frame.I kept muttering "What 
have I done? What have I done?!" over and over like a mantra, as 
though it would suddenly make everything make sense to my spinning 
mind.But I know what I've just done.I've just gotten my ass fired 
from my babysitting job.I just hope I can bluff when she died so 
I don't get too much of my pay docked by her parents. 

"You bastards! I'll never talk!" the man screamed as I and the 
two other guards stood around him, staring down at his bound form. 
My associates were smiling; they were enjoying the orders they'd 
received from higher up. They liked what they were told to do with 
this troublemaker. I wasn't so sure.The man was writhing around, 
flopping onto his back then his stomach much like the fish that 
were scattered around him... the others laughed as the man rolled 
over onto one of the fish and it began to spasm all the more frantic 
between his legs.Still, he remained defiant. He would not answer 
our questions; he would not even give us his name.I told the others 
I was going to watch the door, and walked out in disgust."No sweat, 
we'll teach this fella to put his nose where it doesn't belong" 
one of the other guards called after me.I lit up a cigarette when 
I got outside and sighed. Sea World just wasn't the amusement 
park it used to be. 

Sister Agatha doubled over and began to retch. Her disgusted 
moans and gagging were echoing throughout the small orphanage 
where my sister and I were living. 

Though young children we knew something was very amiss when we 
rushed to her side. Saliva and bile was running from her tongue 
as she stood bent over near the chamber pot, tears filling her 
eyes as she tried to force up something that just didn't seem to 
want to be purged from her system. 

I told my sister to go get the priest Father McArthur, and as she 
did so I asked what her illness was. In my childlike naivety I had 
no idea that she was not ill because of disease. She did not answer 
otherwise, and broke into uncontrollable sobbing. 

Quickly, my sister and the priest entered, and I asked him if he 
knew what was wrong. 

"Well, you see my child..." he started in his reply, choosing 
his words carefully, "She wanted to know what we put in the Body 
of Christ" 

Despite earlier debacles, I thought it best to keep trying the 
dating scene. "Surely" I thought to myself, "This one will be 
fine!" 

We met in the park, and I was compelled to tell her what a lovely 
organic eye she had, as the other one shot me in the face with a laser 
beam. 

With the pleasantries out of the way, we walked about the park 
with her telling me all about the orders for my destruction so 
that humanity would fall in the future. All the while she was trying 
to stab me in the face with her drill hair. 

I think she really likes me. I'd say our hearts ignited when she 
actually consented to a goodbye kiss on the first date, but I think 
it was more my face that ignited as her mouth was a flamethrower. 

Sadly, there was never going to be a second date. As I ran off to 
the hospital to get my burns treated, she activated her self destruction 
sequence in a last ditch attempt to destroy me. 

What a woman! 

It was all going to hell. The enemy had the small town surrounded, 
and it had changed from being a matter of holding out for reinforcements 
to a matter of time before they all died. 

All alone in her position as the enemy began to flood into the town, 
the woman could only pray. She thought of her loved ones... those 
she had left behind to go fight in a war across the globe. 

Death would be better than capture; she realized... the fate 
of women prisoners was always terrible. 

She could hear their feet, the roaring sounds of their vehicle's 
engines as the doom of the defending soldiers came fast into the 
town. 

She offered a final prayer to God to look over her family before 
moving into battle. 

Back home, I was banging the maid while the kids were at school. 

"Damnit Julie" I sighed, "If I'd known you were going to convert 
to Islam, stage a violent uprising amongst the students and take 
the faculty hostage, I'd have stayed home" 

The sirens wailed in the distance. 

"Oh, don't be such a wet blanket" she replied, while crudely beheading 
the arts teacher as one of the film studies students taped it. 

It was typical. Julie was always getting me involved in her crazy 
schemes. Certainly, this one was a touch more insane than her 
usual ones. It certainly was more dangerous than the time she 
got me into ballet club. 

And so it went on, as we waited Julie continued to do more hideous 
things to the hostages. She flayed the skin off of my math's teacher 
while he was still alive, and told me it was for me. 

She did it all with a smile and a skip in her step... I decided I'd 
go down fighting for Julie's crazy cause. 

In the end, we all learned a valuable lesson. 

Governments do negotiate with terrorists. 

Do you like my new TV? 

General Casper, 

I am submitting this report concerning the unwanted presence 
of the liaison to the navy, one Ensign Gardner. The ensign's behaviour 
in this war zone is causing great distractions upon my boys, especially 
with Private Coleman. 

Coleman is a good kid, and unfortunately he and the ensign have 
caught each other's eyes for as long as both have been stationed 
here. I had long feared that this distraction could cost the private 
his health, and now I believe it even more so. 

After being separated from his squad in a heavy frontline engagement 
and being forced to make his own way back to base in rough shape, 
Ensign Gardner broke all protocol and brushing aside all medical 
staff kissed Coleman on the lips. 

Now I am stuck with a dilemma. While we in the higher echelons know 
of Gardner's sex change operation, I doubt Private Coleman has 
any idea, and I don't know how to break it to him. 

I welcome any and all suggestions. 

Sincerely, 

Captain Striker. 

Look... guys. I'm really, really sorry. This has been bothering 
me for ages so... I have to let you all know. 

About two days ago, the class hamster. You all remember Fluffy 
don't you? Well as you recall he went missing. You all thought 
he'd escaped... but he hadn't. 

Just don't be judgemental. But I got tired of seeing him and all 
the other pets in cages. It's just not right and I make no apologies 
for the fact I tried to rescue them all and carry them out of the 
school in my arms. 

I tried to sneak out of the cafeteria with them in my arms but it 
just wouldn't work... so I stole a cardboard box and put them all 
in it. 

The animals are fine. 

But I took a dump in the cafeteria food supplies since I couldn't 
risk going to the toilets with all the animals. 

That's also why I brought a packed lunch yesterday. 

I just hope you can all forgive me. 

I'd been winning a few games when she'd laid some notes on the table. 
I'd never seen that much money before in my life, and she called 
me out to play for it, and if I were to lose she would get the equivalent 
from me. I couldn't let my pride go and tell her I was poor, so I said 
"sure". 

We played, and I was winning. In fact, I was cleaning house. She 
didn't seem the least bit concerned. My confidence began to waver 
as I began to think she was playing me, and I made a few mistakes. 

She never once took the advantage away from me. And in the end when 
all was said and done, I had completely annihilated her. 

After the pre-requisite run around the table with your pants 
down defeated ceremony the woman placed the bills in my sweaty 
hands. 

"You're pretty good. I thought you were an easy mark" she commented, 
and she said something else as she left. It didn't click at first, 
but then I realized why I'd won. 

"Enjoy your victory Scrabble King; I'll be back for your crown 
someday" 

My girlfriend was always on the odd side. She had odd ideas and 
had cut short hair because she'd always end up catching it on fire, 
with some crazy scheme gone wrong being the cause. 

Usually I could humour her, but her new outfit which she had decided 
to unveil to me was nothing short of... well words still were lost 
on me. Why she had thought a shirt ten times too small for her giant 
chesticles was a fashion statement was beyond me. 

"Hey now, come on!" she burst out when my dumbfounded expression 
met her unveiling, "It's a retro 80s look!" 

I tried to answer, to say that I'd never heard of something so daft 
in my life. It had nothing to do with the 80s. Before I got a word 
in though... 

"Does this make my bum look big?" 

When I came too, I was in Paris, in a dark alleyway, with my girlfriend’s 
breasts super glued to my head. Good times. 

"That's a nice portfolio you have there" a cold, level voice came 
from behind Dana as she walked to the boss' office. Whirling on 
one heel, the secretary found herself facing the last person 
she expected... but the first person she feared."Mark! How?!" 
Dana could not believe it. Mark was one of the most powerful office 
workers there ever was, but in his arrogance he had attempted 
to undermine the boss' powers and in a brutal fight was sent to 
another vacation. But here he was, looking stronger than ever!"You 
fools thought you could beat me?! I'm here to get my revenge!" 
Mark announced loudly, pointing a glowing finger at Dana's head, 
"And what better way to prove the boss is incompetent by removing 
his secretary!"IS MARK CHARGING UP HIS FAMED AND DEADLY STAPLER 
REQUISITION BEAM?! WILL DANA BE ABLE TO SURVIVE WITH DIVIDERS 
INTACT?! TUNE IN NEXT TIME FOR ANOTHER STATIONARY PACKED EPISODE 
OF OFFICE JOB Z! 

"It's here! It's here!" One of the other students yelled, as the 
faint and familiar jingle of Green-Sleeves wafted in through 
the window. 

In unison, we all began to pile out of the classrooms, jostling 
and vying for the first position to get the ice cream, the protest 
of the teachers and faculty lost on us all as we prepared to chase 
off the heat in a weekly ritual. 

We were so close we could almost taste the ice blocks and chocolate 
flavoured goods that we would be devouring. 

Then the van exploded. 

The news reported the casualties as 'delicious'. 

I finally regained consciousness some hours later... I had no 
idea where I was and for a moment as my eyes tried to focus against 
the white light that flooded the alleyway I couldn't even remember 
who I was.It was then as I put a hand to my ringing ears I noticed 
the bandages, bound across and over one eye. What had happened 
to me? I pulled myself to my feet and tried to walk, but my right 
ankle was dragging along a ball on a chain.I wanted to cry, as I 
walked slowly and painfully until I found my way home... my head 
continuing to throb with memories half returned filled with 
nothing but pain and abuse...I fell into my mother's arms with 
tears pouring from my one good eye. She held me up, as all strength 
left my body."It's okay dear... you don't have to go to soccer 
practice anymore if you don't want to" 

I'd just stepped out of the house, up and ready for work after a 
relaxing weekend at home. Refreshed and ready for the day I took 
a step out my front door and found my foot dangling over nothing 
but blue sky and cloud. 

At first I began to panic as I turned and found my house gone. Then 
as I began to REALLY panic I realized I wasn't moving. I was standing 
on the sky and not falling! It was an amazing sight. 

Then, with the loud fluttering of tiny leathery wings, a dragon 
flew passed with a small elf girl riding on top of it, waving to 
me. She was calling out something to me. 

"Hey! Mister!" she was yelling to me, "You forgot to take your 
meds on friday! Also you're naked!" 

I later discovered that darn elf didn't mention the dead hooker 
I had still attached to my crotch through an eye wound. Those crafty 
little critters! 

I remember the time I was at a Spring festival, when I was 17. I had 
a beer can and was looking about when someone took the can from 
me. I started in protest, but found my English teacher standing 
behind me, looking drunk. 

She waved a finger at me, "You're still too young. It's my duty 
as an adult to keep you out of trouble" And not hearing a word from 
me she took a sip and led me away from the festival. 

She talked for some time to me, and I got to know her on a deeper level. 
I was quite surprised, and I learned so much about her. She was 
very open. I didn't realize at first what she had led me away for, 
but it soon became apparent. 

"Have you ever kissed a woman?" she asked me, staring at the can. 

Shocked, I answered "Ma'am, you're drunk. Let me take you home" 

I managed to avoid putting my teacher and I in a terrible situation. 
She'd been drinking my pee. 

I could not find any fucking toilets at that stupid festival. 

In the twilight by the water temple that glistened in the night 
she played. Each note a sorrowful tale unto itself, the water 
rippling in places as though dancing in a slow waltz to her mourning 
dirge. 

The soft moonlight cast upon the temple itself made changing 
colors that seemed to respond to the sad, slow song she was playing. 
It was as though in the tranquil and mystical place the temple 
and water had become one. 

It was as the song reached its end, slowly fading away into emptiness 
that LORD SMASHMORE, level 15 Paladin came tromping through 
the forest, the blood of all the forest creatures splattered 
across his +3 plate mail. 

"LOL BARD" LORD SMASHMORE quipped before entering the temple 
to kill things and have hot sweaty manly sex with the water nymphs. 

The bard cried and slashed her wrists on the harp strings. 

I was walking passed the construct, seeing the sights around 
the grounds when we met. I didn't know how she'd gotten in there, 
but it was pretty clear she wanted to get out. 

Slowly following behind her was a deer, its eyes glazed over. 
It was very disturbing how this herbivore was hunting the girl 
like it was a carnivore. 

"Help me!" the girl screamed as I ran up to the bars. 

As the deer got closer it regarded me for a moment, then dismissed 
me. 

I told her that I would get some help, and that I would be back. She 
was screaming at the deer, that she was human. She fell forwards 
onto her hands, and the deer snatched her small skirt in its teeth. 
I ran and managed to get some help quickly. Tranquiliser guns 
were brought in, and the beast was subdued. 

The girl was shaken, incoherently apologising for trespassing. 
I felt for her though. 

No one expects that kind of shit just for sneaking into a furry 
convention. 

My mouth was dry, I couldn't feel anything in my legs but pins and 
needles, and I couldn't remember the last time I'd blinked. 

We'd been neighbours for a long time. Friends almost as long and 
now... I sat on the side of her bed, watching her as she undressed. 
It was all I could have ever hoped for in my youth and yet even as 
she started to climb onto the bed in her underwear I moved back. 

She looked hurt for a moment, asking with her eyes why I'd just 
suddenly moved away. 

I took a deep breath and tried to muster up the courage. I was lucky 
when the words found me, and I poured out my heart to her. I told 
her about how much I cared about her, how much our friendship meant 
to me... 

I told her I would never hurt her. 

Satisfied, her older brother left the chopping block and knife 
on the dresser, and closed the door on his way out. 

I don't know what made me volunteer for the track meet. It didn't 
pay any money, I had to stand around in the sun with a timer in my 
hand, and most of the people competing in the race looked pretty 
ordinary. 

One girl stood out though, with silver hair and a fit body that 
put all the other competitors to shame. I had to look twice... 
she didn't look like she belonged. 

Just as the starter's gun went off, our eyes met, and I almost didn't 
start my timer. 

She moved fast, putting quick and easy distance between herself 
and the rest of the stumbling runners. She was reaching the first 
turn where I stood... and then it happened. 

She started yelling, and ran headlong into me, knocking us both 
down with her on top of me. Our eyes locked, and then she vomited 
on me while at the same time crapping herself. 

Like I said, I don't know what made me volunteer for the Special 
Olympics tryout. 

When I'd let her off of my lap, my cat-girl Jinx immediately ran 
to her makeshift bed and threw herself face onto it, in part to 
hide the tears, in part to avoid putting any sort of pressure on 
her aching behind. I knew exactly why, I was responsible. 

She tried to gingerly rub her backside, but even that just made 
it hurt more. Her failing attempts and pained mewling were cute, 
but the seriousness of the situation didn't allow me to show how 
I thought. 

She looked at me with hurt, accusing eyes. I simply sighed and 
shook my head as I defended myself. 

"Well if you hadn't bitten the vet you could have gotten an injection 
instead of a suppository" 

Our naked upper-bodies pressed against each other as we stood, 
guilt and shame welling up inside me as one of my hands grasped 
tightly to her breast, the other guiding a finger to her open mouth. 

I could tell she was crying, even though I was staring down, trying 
to fix my eyes to her smooth skin on her shoulders, to distract 
myself as we engaged in something forbidden to us, trying to ignore 
the sensation of my finger inside her mouth, moving about. 

It didn't last long, as she pulled my finger away and doubled over 
the toilet, retching and vomiting. She continued to sob, as she 
held herself up over the bowl with shaking arms. 

There is no wacky punch line to this story; I just think bulimia 
is fucking hilarious. 

She was the daughter of a priest and I spent lots of time in the church 
community because of my parents. 

She was easy to manipulate. She was the model of a naive catholic 
girl. She barely knew anything about sex and I was able to manipulate 
her just by telling her that whatever we did was something Jesus 
wanted. 

We'd come so close, and at great risk I managed to get her into my 
room late at night while my folks were out, and into my bed. I fed 
her the same bull as always, and made to look like I was going to 
sleep with plans on getting her when she was half-awake. To my 
surprise, she touched me first, and all the times had gotten her 
to touch and kiss me flashed through my head. Then she spoke... 

"Thank you for all your love. You're almost like Jesus yourself" 

I asked why, feeling suitably guiltier as time went on. 

"Jesus loved lepers too" 

As I sat in my depressed state in my quarters, I heard approaching 
steps. The door opened, and in stepped two women. Harlots sent 
by my men to cheer me up. I couldn't move to send them out, so I let 
them rest on the bed either side of me. Then they asked what had 
happened as they ran their fingers across my upper legs. 

I told them of the battle, Sergeant Talker and I led the charge 
to the very teeth of the guns and how we were engulfed in a horrible 
explosion. I came to when the battle was over, somehow uninjured. 
It was a miracle. 

The harlots remarked that they thought I had lost my legs, but 
discovered I was merely kneeling in the darkness. Then, they 
asked why I was so depressed. 

I pointed to a glass jar with a penis bobbing in the preserving 
fluid. 

"I'm trying to figure out how to send the Sergeant home" 

Then the harlots threw up on me. My men were good to me. I hadn't 
even told them I was into that kind of thing. 

"Will you always love me?" She asked as we walked along together 
through the wetlands. 

"Of course" I replied, looking to my watch. 

"Forever?" She pressed the question as the wind began to pick 
up around us, whipping the plant life about at a feverish pitch. 
Her hair too whipped about. 

"Of course, forever" I added onto my earlier statement, before 
checking my watch, "Hey, stand right here for a second, I want 
to take a photo. 

She asked why I was checking my watch, but I ignored her, pretending 
I couldn't hear her over the building roar on the wind. I stood 
at a distance and took out my camera out, kneeling. 

Right on time, the low flying plane swooped low over us, clipping 
my date in the back of the head with its landing gear before heading 
back on into the sky. 

I checked my watch one more time. 

I still had plenty of time to go bang her sister. 

I came to with the roar of the flood still echoing in my ears from 
when I'd been knocked out. The back of my head was still sore but 
I managed to sit up, and found myself looking at two young girls. 
I recognized them as having been at the party... 

"The party!" I suddenly yelled, startling the pair, "What happened?" 

They shook their heads sadly as I became aware we were on a small 
row boat... 

"The flood took everyone. We were lucky to find the boat and you 
unconscious in it" the red head explained. Fate had been kind 
to me, and in a way so cruel. I looked about, finally aware of the 
murky brown sea around us, as we sloshed on random currents taking 
us where it pleased. 

"We were fools" the other girl sighed, "No sewer system could 
control what we have wrought today... this is punishment from 
God for defying him with our revelry" 

Indeed... Vindaloo night had been an outright disaster. 

I took my daughter out onto the river, with the intentions of a 
nice picnic on the shore of the far less populated side. It was 
a great idea, and she agreed upon it as a sort of father-daughter 
thing. 

Unfortunately, ever since I took her to the old paint factory 
where I worked and we didn't have enough face masks she'd been 
a little loopy. Couple in the fact she'd developed Tourette’s 
after the time I played a prank on her where she tried to eat her 
sandwich and bit a live electrical wire and, all of a sudden she 
decided to start screaming obscene things while rocking the 
boat. 

I was forced to hit her several times about the head with the oar 
until she quietened down, and fell into a coma. 

So it's with great honour I accept this Father of the Year Award. 
Thank you. I dedicate it to my daughter in the front row. 

Hey sweetie! CATCH WITH YOUR FACE! 

When I went to college, I moved into a rented house with Julie, 
a friend of mine. She was generally pretty easy going, aside from 
the fact every morning she'd walk into my room and put her foot 
on my face until I'd get up and make her breakfast. 

Well, one morning I decided to get her back. We'd had a party the 
night before, and she was still crashed out on the couch. I took 
a feather I'd gotten for just this occasion and began to run it 
across the bottom of her foot. 

Almost immediately her foot swelled up and began spraying puss 
all over me... in my eye, up my nose and even in my mouth. 

When she woke up and I'd cleaned myself off, I asked her why she 
never told me she was allergic to birds. 

She responded that she wasn’t and that her foot did that every 
morning and just needed to be wiped off. 

You can still see the mark on the carpet in the living room where 
I put her head through the table. 

Dracula and I met at high school. I was trying to pass my exams to 
get into college, he was trying to seduce and drink the blood of 
my math teacher. She was a lesbian, so you can imagine how well 
that went. 

He and I met when he was halfway through drinking the blood of my 
ex-girlfriend in the principal's office. We hit it off straight 
away and became fast friends. 

He did have some eccentric problems though. Whenever I went over 
to his castle, I had to bring a female friend for him to devour, 
but he really liked the fat chicks. 

Our friendship fell apart at my graduation, when he stole my little 
sister and ran off. I was shocked and sickened as I watched him 
run off over the horizon. 

He didn't even notice I wore the dress he liked. Freak. 

"Pick up your little sister from ballet" my mother had told me. 
I had nothing better to do, so I went. I used to go there so I knew 
where to pick her up. 

I heard girlish laughter when I came to ballet room, and when I 
opened the door everyone but my sister turned towards me and let 
out a surprised gasp. 

My sister didn't move because she was bound by several windings 
of rope. It looked uncomfortable. Her outfit was almost translucent, 
but I couldn't tell if it was from the routine they'd been doing 
or what the heck it was. I wanted to ask what the hell was going on, 
but I was just so dumbfounded I couldn't find the words. 

"Brother!" my sister called out, before rolling over towards 
me, "Dad forgot to untie me last night. I'm soooo embarrassed.” 

That night I burned down our house. 

After school one day, my girlfriend came up to me and asked me to 
help me with her grocery shopping. Quite happy to trade effort 
for nookie I accepted and we walked to the grocery store near her 
house. 

In we went, and for an hour my girlfriend went back and forth around 
the vegetables and fruit, picking up watermelons, rock melons, 
lettuce and pineapples. Never once did she actually take any, 
always setting them back down. 

I managed to resist the urge to ask, as crazy as all this seemed. 
She was a methodical girl, I expected this much from her. 

Finally she picked up what had to be the largest cabbage in the 
store and looked at me, her face dead flat and serious. 

"Tonight, I am going to shove this up your butt" 

I guess she found out I had sex with her mother, then. 

Before me stood the priestess, who was holding the Spear of Fate. 
She seemed happy, and at the same time nervous. Although the hardest 
parts were done, there seemed to be one more task ahead of me. 

"You have passed all the trials. You have succeeded in fulfilling 
all the requirements set by the prophecy. Our destinies are all 
bound to you, especially my own" she spoke, stuttering slightly 
at the last part, "There is one last task for you, hero" 

She knelt, and as she undid the strings on her dress the fabric 
slid off her thin frame. She stood up, grasping the spear tightly 
in one hand and stepped back, out of the clothes pile she'd made. 

"Put on the dress" she ordered me, as all my teachers and trainers 
began walking into the area. 

After the bukkake, I didn't feel like being the hero anymore. 

"Hey there" a sultry female voice called to me as I stood on the 
beach, where I had been taking the lull in activity to watch the 
waves for a few seconds. 

I turned my head and found myself staring almost immediately. 
Before me she stood, her bikini top already hoisted up over her 
ample breasts. People had to be watching, but I couldn't tear 
my eyes away to look. 

"You look like a smart, handsome man" she started with her every 
word sliding into my ears and into my brain like a jolt of electricity, 
"Perhaps if you could help me with a problem, I could take you 'out'". 

Before I could try and stutter anything out, a volley-ball sped 
through the air and smacked the beautiful woman right in the face. 

"The ball was IN you slut!" Was yelled from the other side of the 
volley ball net. 

At first, when she was alone in her cell the poor young girl had 
hope. She was alone, and could formulate an escape in her mind. 
This lull lasted no much longer, as bricks began to open in the 
walls around her. She was distracted, each wall having had several 
bricks removed. She could not see what was behind the walls, the 
holes pitch black and unlit. 

Then, at a muffled command from outside the cell an arm shot from 
a hole to her right, grabbing at her dress. Then another command 
was uttered and another hand snaked out. Soon she was being grasped 
and groped by all manner of mechanical limbs, her shrieks echoing 
off the stone walls but falling on all deaf ears as she was stripped 
naked. 

I watched on a TV screen with the one in control of it all. He was 
smiling sickly, and I wondered how far the Inspector had fallen 
to end up like this. 

"Go Go Gadget rape" he commanded, and I finally was forced to turn 
away in disgust. 

"Hey there boys" the woman in the playboy bunny suit greeted us 
as we filed into the room and took our seats, the walls all around 
us festively decorated with all sorts of cute drawings. 

"You can call me Bunny, looking for a carrot" the woman said, wiggling 
her hips a little before passing around drinks. We were at most 
silent but appreciative, as 'Bunny' went around, complimenting 
us on our appearance, leaning in front of us to put down our drinks 
to give us a clear look at her cleavage. 

This went on for some time, most of us sitting around with bemused 
expressions on our faces as Bunny sat on my lap and stroked my hair, 
talking in innuendos about burrows and whatnot. 

It seemed like forever, but still not long enough before she had 
gone. We looked at each other for a moment and came to a unanimous 
agreement. 

Dalores always gave the best corporate presentations when she 
was on her stress medication. 

We all lay down, looking up at the sky. It was so beautiful, the 
way the clouds seemed to move in fast motion across the endless 
blue canvas above us. It was an ever moving image of creation, 
and we all would look away as the light streamed through the clouds 
onto our faces.I looked over my left to Jennifer, who was staring 
up with wide and open eyes. Even without the sun she had a soft glow 
around her head. The other three were beginning to fall asleep 
around us, content to lie in the sun's glow for as long as they were 
allowed.When they dozed off, I placed my hand upon Jennifer's 
shoulder and nudged her gently. She turned he head around and 
looked at me, tears in her eyes."It's okay" I whispered comfortingly, 
"Ford Broncos just aren't made to jump ten buses" 

She was so heavy in my arms, limp as she just lay there staring up 
at me with glazing eyes. Every breath was like a pained groan, 
her chest rising and falling with some difficulty. 

"I...I'm sorry" she murmured, one of her hands reaching slowly 
to clutch at the crimson fluids spread across her belly, "I screwed 
up..." 

I felt the tears welling up in my eyes, as I stared at the stain. 
I was too late... there was really nothing I could do. I could only 
watch as her eyelids fluttered and closed, her head rolling to 
the side as she fell completely limp against me. 

"It's okay" I muttered back, despite knowing she could not hear 
me now, "I'll just buy some more jelly donuts" 

When I couldn't think of anything to write, I used to creep across 
to the edge of a largely uninhabited wetlands area and have a cigarette, 
watching the military jets low fly on their training exercises. 

This time however, I wasn't alone. Deeper in amongst the water, 
ignorant or perhaps uncaring of the dangers of the snakes in the 
wetlands a well dressed young woman held her child, and likewise 
her child held a flower. They looked so serene, so at peace... 
I found my self staring; none of us even flinching as the first 
jet flew overhead, whipping our clothes and hair in the aftermath 
of its passing. 

Then the second jet to pass disgorged its napalm load directly 
onto the pair, and I could hear their screams even over the jet's 
engines. 

I didn't mind so much. The government's anti-hippy bill was sound 
in my mind. There just wasn't much to have sex with when they finally 
stopped burning. 

We lay there, for what seemed like an eternity. I couldn't remember 
how we had ended up in each other's arms, on the floor in my attic. 
I didn't know how she felt, but all I could think about were questions 
that I should have asked before I had crossed the line. Questions 
like "Is this right?" and "Should I do this?" 

I couldn't see anything but her eyes, that's all there was to it 
as the snow fell outside the sounds of carols being sung down the 
street wafted through the window. I wondered how she felt... 
again, another thought too late. I don't think I could stop myself 
from becoming lost in those eyes even if I wanted to. 

All my fears were gone though, as she kissed me. We lay there as 
midnight rolled about on Christmas night, and I received the 
greatest present of all... her love. 

In return I gave her a Dirty Sanchez. 

Merry Christmas! 

To get through college I took a lot of odd jobs on weekends. Probably 
the weirdest one involved a young girl I was supposed to mind for 
her rich folks, who were leaving for an emergency overnight business 
trip and wanted to make sure she was fine in the mansion. It didn't 
help this girl was not very smart or world-wise. 

When I arrived she practically dragged me out the door to do some 
shopping, and I ended up acting more like a servant than a minder. 
I was getting paid a lot so it didn't matter. 

I only looked away for a moment at something she had pointed at, 
and when I'd turned back she was gone. I raced around the place 
calling her name and praying she'd just gone to the bathroom or 
something. I finally saw her a few minutes later, trapped in a 
cage strapped to the back of a truck that was leaving the scene. 
I tried to chase after them but I couldn't keep up. As she disappeared 
around a corner I she called out to me. 

"It's okay! They're taking me to see their puppies!" 

Day 1: I have been assigned by the clubhouse to infiltrate the 
enemy's compound and gain access to all their secrets. 

Day 27: My infiltration into the girl's club has gone flawlessly, 
as I have now been initiated into the second level of the group 
by way of creating a facade of being a completely unattractive 
and easily manipulated. I have earned Subject #25's friendship, 
which should serve me well in the long run. 

Day 56: Third circle engagement has been completed. By drinking 
the blood of #46's still beating heart I have been granted the 
powers of the club's god N'SHUBKTH and can now see into the darkness. 
Despite my corruption I continue to work for my fellow boys in 
learning all the secrets of these 'girls'. 

Day 65: My penis fell off. 

Day 120: Sleepover at Mandy's. We're going to talk about Cory, 
he's so dreamy. 

After her husband died, Michelle had always been a sad figure. 
Also an incredibly disproportioned figure as well, but with 
the man she loved (a dwarven paladin of some renown) I didn't want 
to give her any reason to knee me in the face. I'm a sensitive guy 
like that. 

With her father and mother in another country, she was all alone. 
I was the only person around that she spoke to on a regular occasion, 
and only because a glandular problem meant I couldn't really 
run away without getting really dizzy. 

The last day I saw her she was standing on the cliff-face overlooking 
the town. I'd blacked out earlier and woken up there. She smiled 
to me faintly, and loosely held the flowers she usually lay at 
her husband's grave as she resumed staring out. 

"Pippy" she said, getting my name completely incorrect, "I think 
I'm ready to mo-" 

It was at that point the wind picked up, and she snapped at the knees, 
her upper part sailing over the edge. 

I laughed. 

I could hear the click of the button being pressed from the other 
end of the phone. I looked to my screen and watched. I watched as 
the internet counted down to its own doom. 

I can only imagine what could have been going through the minds 
of all the users of the internet as it began to tell them it was ending 
its own existence with a large digital timer 

. 

Somewhere young obese men were scrambling to enter in their credit 
card numbers, to see one last piece of tit-flesh rolled out from 
a cheap bra on a webcam before their world collapsed in on itself. 

Every single girl on the internet revealed to their boyfriends 
that they were men, and no one really minded. They just e-held 
each other as the sun slowly rose. 

I heard that when the internet died everyone who had ever been 
insulted by someone they'd never met ejaculated. I looked outside 
my window at that apparent moment and saw a distorted rainbow 
stretching across the sky. 

My best friend Dan was a genius, a real bona fide genius when it 
came to robotics. He could change the world if he wanted, but for 
his eccentric channelling of his works. For years he'd worked 
on and off making what he considered his ultimate partner, and 
then one day 'she' was sitting on his bedroom floor. I was speechless 
at the time; he'd really designed a perfect woman. 

She didn't have a mouth. Perfection! 

What truly amazed me was the universal remote he'd installed 
in her breasts. With subtle nuances in his grasping at her artificial 
mammaries he was able to turn on his DVD player and select scenes 
in seconds without even looking up. The way he handled her brought 
a tear to my eyes. 

I decided to take him out for a drink, to celebrate his achievement. 
We decided to take his car, though Dan was loathe to leave his creation 
at home. He took her to the doorway as I walked to his garage, and 
he issued her some commands to keep her busy while he was gone. 

Then he hugged her. It was beautiful, this man and his creation 
pressed close against one another, loathe to separate. 

Then her tits beeped, and the garage door flew open into my face. 

I love my work. It's hard work you know, but I'll be damned if I don't 
get a warm fuzzy feeling at the end of each and every day. I know 
that when I tuck myself into bed at night and dream of being smothered 
in butter by Napoleon, I'm doing so having made the world a better 
and safer place. 

My name is Fondles McGee, and I'm a titty inspector. 

I know what you're thinking "Oh god I want to feel you inside me". 
Well, if I were you I'd be asking something that doesn't creep 
me out half as much. Mind you, I also sometimes get people being 
sceptical of my work, and I just tell them of how it all began. 

I used to be a normal high school boy aside from the butter fetish, 
with what I thought was a normal girlfriend. We used to do things 
most couples would do, me trying to get up more bases and her giving 
me blue balls. One day though, I managed to get the closest I could 
to that beautiful home run. 

We were in her room, changing to go for a swim. She was turned away 
and behind a screen, so I took my chances to try to 'escalate' our 
passions as it were, slipping behind her and deftly sliding my 
hands up under her bra. She didn't have time to protest as I grasped 
those pert, firm mounds in my hands... and then she made an odd 
click sound. 

She let out a gasp that sounded a lot like "Allah Ackbar" and vagina 
detonated violently and downwards. When I came to I learned from 
the police that she was a tool of Islamic extremists, brainwashed 
to offer her virginity to the US President and destroy him as he 
fumbled with her nipples. 

From that day onwards I resolved to stop these vaginas of mass 
destruction before they happened, and I found my true calling. 

And that's why I'm in prison. How about you?
