A meme that originated from the original Japanese [[Yotsuba]] bulletin board. It is often accompanied by the words "i dunno."

The first appearence in [[4chan]] was a post, "i'm a faggot, lol! ¯\(º_o)/¯", by [[Anonymous]]. While influenced by Japanese Shift_JIS emoticons, the special characters exist in the ISO 8859-1 encoding. Codepoint AF is the macron (hands) and the left eye can be either Codepoint B0 (degree sign) or BA (ordinal character). The Unicode codepoints are U+0304 and U+00B0/U+00BA respectively.

At some points in history, ¯\(º_o)/¯ was used as the sorting header for the [[:Category:Traps|traps]] at [[CHANCHAN]].

=== How do I shot web? ===
[[Image:HowDoIShot.jpg|thumb]]
Phrase started by Natural Selection players; in NS, one of the alien races can actually shoot spider webs as a weapon. One day, some Goons (see [[Something Awful]]) were playing NS when a lot of newbies and clueless people were on the server. "how do i shot web" was one of the questions that kept coming up. Someone took a screenshot, posted it to FYAD, and it went from there.

Most commonly seen on [[/b/]] as an image macro, featuring Spider-Man holding out his arms in an "I dunno..." gesture; this later inspired a series of shopped images, including one with a Japanese newscaster holding out his arms in the same gesture (along with Spider-Man and a number of anime characters), and a meme where a picture of a falling person is shopped to say "Hey Spider-Man, how do I shot web?" (with Spider-Man replying "dunno, lol"). Juliet Nao Zhang from the anime My Otome, who has spider-themed powers and a robe which bears a passing resemblance to Spidey's costume, has also been spotted in shopped screenshots asking the question. When [[An Hero|Mitchell]] became [[An Hero]], his faced was also shopped over spiderman's, with the text "[[An Hero|How do I shot self?]]"
