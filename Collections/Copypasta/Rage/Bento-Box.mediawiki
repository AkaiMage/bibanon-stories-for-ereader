This copypasta refers to a request for a Japanese lunchbox by a guy who had such insane and strict demands on its features that it crossed the border into pathetic. It once very common on [[/b/]], so much so that ErectileMaster [[4chan Wordfilters|filtered]] "porn" to "bento box" for fun one day in 2004.

 Im looking for a Bento Box, it cant be pinku (thats japanese for pink) or any girl color. It has to be of 2 or more kotoba (thats 
 japanese for 2 compartments) and has be be chibi (small) sized. And has to be really kawaii (cute). Also It has to be about 10-20 
 bux. And you have to post pics of it first (i want to make shure it's kawaii (cute)). And it would be nice if it came with matching 
 chopstick holder (WITH chopsticks). OH! and it CANNOT have any cartoon pictures, or be made out of plastic. It has to be made of 
 ceramic, or something like that. Also it would be nice if it was made in japan. and not in china or corea (korea) or whatever. I 
 have found a Bento Box similar to the one im describing in e-bay, but it was 1 kotoba, and i dont want my gohan (rice) to touch my 
 other things (it can get wet and i would not like that, plus 2 compartments looks more kawaii)
