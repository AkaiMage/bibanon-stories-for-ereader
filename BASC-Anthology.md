## LP Archive
A "Let's Play" is a playthrough of a video game that is recorded and shared with the public. Although no better known for the numerous Youtube LPs (and in fact many of the LPs on the archive are in video format), there are also LPs using screenshots and text, or even hybrids of both formats. The LP Archive saves interesting LPs from Something Awful.

* [Animal Crossing](http://lparchive.org/Animal-Crossing/) - Not your daddy's Animal Crossing.
   * Animal Crossing is a series of games where the player settles in a small town. You can pick fruit, dig up fossils, catch insects, fish, and interact with the locals. All of your efforts are to repay your crippling debt to the local friendly store owner, Tom Nook, after which he expands your house without your consent and charges you an even higher debt. Sounds peaceful and boring? **It won't be.**

* [Civilization 4](http://lparchive.org/Civilization-4/) - Extremely detailed historical narrative.
   * Civilization is a historical 4X game, where you can take control of a civilization as a famous leader, both of which gives certain advantages. However, because the game allows the player to control the course of human history for 6000 years, the historical narrative isn't as interesting as it real history. This LP brings in the military campaigns, revolutions, political intrigue, and cultural development that makes human history so interesting. Sadly, the LP stops in the early 1700's.

*[Dwarf Fortress - Boatmurdered](http://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/) - Even crazier than your average game of DF
   * Dwarf Fortress is a game where you take 7 dwarfs and some meager supplies into the wilderness, and after braving every possible danger, from carp to giant colossi to goblins to miasma to insane dwarfs, you will have the greatest underground fortress in all the lands. Of course, it takes a lot of experience and just as much luck to even get a minor farming community running before you get overrun by kobolds. As the DF community knows though, _losing is fun_. This particular playthrough can be said to encompass everything that saying represents.

*[Gazillionaire Deluxe](http://lparchive.org/Gazillionaire-Deluxe/) - The rise of a trading empire
   * I honestly have no idea what Gazillionaire Deluxe is. It looks like a crappy Flash game or a simple game from the 90's. Regardless, this is still a great rags-to-riches story.

*[Half Life 2](http://lparchive.org/Half-Life-2/) - I guarantee this is actually HL2
   * So first off, this isn't actually Half Life 2, it's Half Life ~~Episode 3~~ 1.
