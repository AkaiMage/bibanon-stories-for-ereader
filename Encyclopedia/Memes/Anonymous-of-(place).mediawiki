Semi-popular, multi-board [[tripfag]] meme. Instead of posting merely as Anonymous, some [[/a/]]ssholes became tripfags by including what country they lived in (e.g., Anonymous of Denmark). Evolved a bit to include states (for US residents) and cities (when a state/country had already been borrowed). Tripfags who use this meme are sometimes referred to as merely by their location (e.g., California). Though distinctly an /a/ meme, the trend has also found use in related boards like /c/. Origin unknown, but most likely [[list of notable namefags and tripfags#/a/|Anonymous of Germany]].
