Better known as "QUALITY Cabbage", the plant in question was featured in an episode of ''Yoake Mae Yori Ruri Iro Na'' and quickly became a popular meme on [[/a/]] due to its lack of similarities with an actual cabbage or any other vegetable. Rather, the alleged 'cabbage' resembled a large, green bowling ball without holes. 

Despite its short-lived appearance, the Cabbage is considered one of the premiere examples of [[QUALITY]] in recent anime, and its popularity pushed it through the first round of the [[GAR#SaiGar|SaiGar 2007]] "Man among Men" tournament, though some [[Anonymous]] criticize the notion of being GAR for an inanimate object. In the DVD release of ''Yoake Mae Yori Ruri Iro Na'', the Cabbage was altered to resemble a real cabbage. /a/ is divided as to whether this was an improvement.
