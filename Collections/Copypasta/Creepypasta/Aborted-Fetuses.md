If I was a girl, I would get pregnant as many times as possible, then have abortions after the third month of being pregnant so I would deliver a potatoe sized 1/3 developed dead fetus. Then I would take the fetus, put it in a jar of preservative liquid and put it on a shelf in a secret room in my house. And I would do it until I had so many the room's walls were nothing but potato sized aborted fetuses. Then I would have a kid, and when they're bad I would make them sit in the fetus room and remind them of how easy I could have aborted their ass.
