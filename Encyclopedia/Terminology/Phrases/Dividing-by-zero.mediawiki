: A [[meme]] based off of the fact that dividing by zero is impossible (and causes an error on pretty much every computer there is). [[Dividing by Zero]] is said to have dire consequences, such as opening black holes. Seen as "I DIVIDED BY ZERO OH SHI-". Also, in FlyFF (Fly for Fun), if you use the ingame calculator (Trade/Shop window) and divide by zero, the game will crash. Try dividing by zero on Windows' calculator!
