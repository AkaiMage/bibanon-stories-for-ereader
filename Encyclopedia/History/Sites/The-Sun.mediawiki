The Sun is a fascist newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch (not to be confused with the 700 billion ton ball of hydrogen around which Earth and another 7 planets and 1 dwarf planet revolve <s>Take that Pluto!</s> Take that retard!). They enraged /i/ when the forum censored truth that the parents of Madeleine McCann murdered her.

=The Raids=

A series of raids began on the 12th of September. Everyday at 10pm GMT Anonymous has raided and destroyed the Sun forums, and will continue to into the foreseeable future. An extensive library of McCann related copypasta was built and used for the raids. The last raid was full of win and success, and took place between 10:30 and 12:00 September 15th. Another one is in the works for the same time.

==Teresa Cooper==

Teresa Cooper is a supposed raep victim and author who posted on The Sun boards. She attracted Anon's attention by musing that her barren and failing forum hadn't been raided. Naturally, it was DDoSed, spammed, and in two days completely removed from the internet.

==CornishCream==

CornishCream is the name of a The Sun user who was on the featured page for much of the raiding. Some investigation revealed a series of nude photos posted in her profile. She has not yet been raided or used in a raid, but plans are being drawn up.
