A forced meme derived from an episode of Dexter's Laboratory, where Dexter builds a robotic parrot to copy what he says. It eventually goes haywire and starts copying other people's words, and threatens to unveil Dexter's secret lab.

Also seen as "SMOOTH MOVE DEXTER", "DEXTER'S A COOKIE", "DEXTER'S A STUPID GIRL", "THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES" and "WORMS AND PLASTIC MINNOWS". Often posted with a picture of the parrot.
