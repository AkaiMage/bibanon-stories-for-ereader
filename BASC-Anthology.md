## LP Archive
A "Let's Play" is a playthrough of a video game that is recorded and shared with the public. Although no better known for the numerous Youtube LPs (and in fact many of the LPs on the archive are in video format), there are also LPs using screenshots and text, or even hybrids of both formats. The LP Archive saves interesting LPs from Something Awful.

* [Animal Crossing](http://lparchive.org/Animal-Crossing/) - Not your daddy's Animal Crossing.
   * Animal Crossing is a series of games where the player settles in a small town. You can pick fruit, dig up fossils, catch insects, fish, and interact with the locals. All of your efforts are to repay your crippling debt to the local friendly store owner, Tom Nook, after which he expands your house without your consent and charges you an even higher debt. Sounds peaceful and boring? **It won't be.**

* [Civilization 4](http://lparchive.org/Civilization-4/) - Extremely detailed historical narrative.
   * Civilization is a historical 4X game, where you can take control of a civilization as a famous leader, both of which gives certain advantages. However, because the game allows the player to control the course of human history for 6000 years, the historical narrative isn't as interesting as it real history. This LP brings in the military campaigns, revolutions, political intrigue, and cultural development that makes human history so interesting. Sadly, the LP stops in the early 1700's.
