"Shower and change... it'll make you feel a bit better, I'll sort you out some bedding."  
"Thats... nostalgic." I thought to myself, closing the door again and heading into the shower"  
"Wouldn't exactly be a lie, even if the rest of it would be, jumping out of the shower I brushed my teeth"  
"Morning" I said without turning around "Go and grab a shower, I've left a towel and some more clothes for you in there, we'll worry about getting yours back later"  
""You hungry? I don't know about you but a shower and some food sound pretty good about now"  
"came back and I jumped in the shower making sure to scrub my face well to get the pig blood off of me"  
"Go ahead and take a shower, at least now you can wear your own pyjamas right?"  
"The next day I got up, showered, dressed and left for work without waking her up"  
"We polished off the pizza and watched TV until 10pm, noticing the news coming on I said "Cmon, you should probably go take a shower now, I'll set up your bed and stuff"  
"I quickly showered expecting her to be up but she was still under than light blue sleeping bag quilting"  
"I pushed the laptop onto the middle seat on top of the empty pizza box and stood up, 'I'm going to go take a shower'"

Shower thread? Awesome!

Seriously though, I've been following this thread since the first post was made, what, 30+ hours ago? Loving every second, very entertaining read. Cant wait for the conclusion.

Yeah ages, only saw it about 4 hours ago, where I thought it was way, way over...  
Also, britfag here, it's 9pm so he will probably go within a few hours...

I am predicting his story happened about 16 days ago.
