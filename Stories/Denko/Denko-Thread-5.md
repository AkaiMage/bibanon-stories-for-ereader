##OP  
I’m incredibly worried, honestly…  
I was bullied in grade school too, but this is just awful.  
Somebody, please help me…

###2ch  
Become a masochist and all your worries will melt away.  
  
###2ch  
I’ll help. Give me the name of your school, your year, and the bully’s name, phone number, and anything else you know.  
  
###2ch  
YOU AGAIN  
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE FLOWER-VIEWING  
  
###2ch  
I’ll help just this once, OP.  
  
What exactly do you want from us?  
  
##OP  
I want to know what I can do to not get bullied… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
Tell us the sexual parts of your harassment, OP.  
  
##OP  
I was never bullied in my first year of college, but the bullying’s started again…  
I just ignored it at first, but people are telling me I’m creepy and to die to my face.  
Most of the time they pick on me by sprinkling me with toilet water.  
I’m afraid it’ll be like this my whole time in college… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
I can’t help but think there’s a reason.  
  
###2ch  
I’m honestly surprised they’d do that kind of bullying in college. That’s rough. In grade school, if you’re hurt or made fun of, you could always change schools, but college…?  
Is it possible you could avoid the bullies?  
  
##OP  
Thank you… (´；ω；`)  

More and more rumors are spreading about me, so I’m being called names by people I don’t even know.  
I wish there were some way to stop the rumors… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
denko  
  
##OP  
I was usually teased for having a timid personality, but it’s really rough getting bullied even after I’m in college…  
  
###2ch  
Bullying in college…?  
  
###2ch  
Hahaha, something seems awfully familiar about this thread…  
  
The Denko guy???  
  
###2ch  
Getting bullied in college must mean it’s a pretty sucky college…  
  
###2ch  
You are the cause, OP. (´･ω･`)  
  
##OP  
Hey, even if there were a good reason, I shouldn’t have to put up with bullying at this age… (´･ω･`)  
I’ve been skipping school a lot out of fear…  
  
###2ch  
Did you get to confess under the cherry blossoms?  
  
##OP  
Sorry, I meant to give some details about me… (´･ω･`)  
I’ve never really written anything like this before, but, uh…  

Hair: Tackey-esque  
Face: Normal  
Clothes: I don’t know much about them, but ordinary pants and shirts  
Height: 170 cm, pretty normal  
Personality: Quiet (´･ω･`)  
  
Something like that…  
Any advice given that?  
  
###2ch  
I was bullied once.  
  
In my case, after a while, I didn’t give them any reaction.  
And then soon enough, it stopped.  
I couldn’t make friends with them, but at least I could get them to not want to bully me.  
  
I don’t think it’s a very good idea to ditch school.  
You’re just feeding them by letting them get to you.  
  
##OP  
Really???  
Even skipping school counts as a reaction, huh…  
What should I do… Deep down, I really want to just tell them “Stop it!!”… (´･ω･`)  
Although I can’t bring myself to say it in front of them anyway.  
Do I have to just put up with it for now? I do want to go to school, but it hurts…  
  
###2ch  
>Deep down, I really want to just tell them “Stop it!!”  
  
Is that Denko speaking?  
  
###2ch  
No, you shouldn’t tell them “Stop it!” either.  
If you do, they’ll just want to bully you even more.  
That’s what they enjoy, and that’s why they do it.  
  
First, you want to think of it like “Oh, this again. They just don’t give up.”  
Make sure they don’t get any enjoyment out of it.  
  
It might take about two months for it to go away for good.  
  
By the way, what are these rumors? Where did they come from?  
  
##OP  
Ooogh… I see… (´･ω･`)  
No reaction at all…  
I don’t know if I can handle it, considering I was bullied in grade school too…  
But two months is better than forever, I suppose…  
It’s bad timing though, since I’m mentally exhausted after my girlfriend broke up with me…  
  
I don’t really want to talk about the rumors. (´･ω･`) I’m not sure what to say about them…  
  
###2ch  
Riiight, don’t want to talk about it…  
Because you’re the cause of them, right?  
If I’m wrong, just tell us so, so we can give you more useful advice.  
  
###2ch  
This is the Denko guy?  
  
###2ch  
Denko’s boyfriend → (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
Thought so.  
He’s as bad at listening to people as ever.  
  
###2ch  
THEY BROKE UP?  
  
###2ch  
^ Not like they were dating to begin with.  
  
###2ch  
This guy’s a college student, really??  
He sounds like a middle-schooler at best.  
  
##OP  
If I mentioned Denko right away, no one would reply honestly… (´･ω･`)  
So I just wanted to ask about the bullying…  
  
###2ch  
LOL, the Denko guy…  
Geez, I’m curious what happened with her.  
  
##OP  
Can we just have a conversation here?  
I don’t have any friends, so if I can’t even talk here, I’m gonna feel really defeated… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
Okay, dude, listen. Listen. LISTEN.  
The previous threads were all about Denko and all that stuff, right?  
And you talked about her plenty in them, but not here.  
If you didn’t want Denko to come up here, then why the thread title?  
It’s completely obvious you’re the same guy.  
  
##OP  
It’s a very delicate situation, so even a single word could hurt matters…  
Why does everyone want to talk about Denko? Why not me?  
I’m not really in a situation where I can talk about her anyway… (´･ω･`)  
  
##OP  
See, and now everyone attacks me… (´･ω･`)  
I’ve noticed that whenever I talk about Denko, I get unpleasant responses.  

So please consider that I’m very hurt right now and don’t want to talk about it… (´･ω･`)  
Back to the bullying, I don’t want to do what’s being recommended…  
I want to know a more peaceful method, because I can’t put up with this for two months…  
If only things could go back to normal in a day…  
  
###2ch  
>I’ve noticed that whenever I talk about Denko, I get unpleasant responses.  
>So please consider that I’m very hurt right now  
  
And Denko’s been hurt far, far worse.  
  
###2ch  
Give it to us clearly, okay?  
Are you gonna ditch or are you gonna post?  
  
##OP  
Sorry, I’ll write some…  
It really does put me at ease when I make posts here… (´･ω･`)  
I want to live in peace. I haven’t been sleeping well lately.  
  
Why do I have to put up with a life of bullying?  
I don’t know, but I know I have to face it somehow…  
And I want the people bullying me to know they’re being silly.  
  
###2ch  
While it’s true you might be criticized when you talk about Denko, some people won’t give advice if you avoid talking about her. Just understand that.  
  
###2ch  
If you don’t like the environment at school, look for something new.  
Absorb yourself in a hobby, or go somewhere where rumors about OP won’t reach you, and do what you want to do.  
  
##OP  
Thanks for the serious reply! (´･ω･`)  
Not giving a reaction is really hard…  
I might have done so without even realizing it.  
Hobbies… Uh, I like H games and comics, but no real hobbies…  
Do you think things would settle themselves if I didn’t go to school for two months?  
  
###2ch  
Do you have any idea how much trouble you’ve caused Tendou?  
You need to apologize to Tendou for everything, now.  
  
##OP  
Uh? (´･ω･`) You know Denko’s nickname?  
Are you from school?  
  
##OP  
You know the nickname Tendou?  
If you’re acquaintances, I want her to reply… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
This isn’t any time for you to be interrogating me, you creep.  
A loner like you never considering the other’s feelings and pushing himself on her is the worst of the worst.  
  
If you don’t get that, then you’re beyond all help.  
  
###2ch  
^ Could you tell us more details about the flower-viewing if possible?  
  
##OP  
IF YOU’RE SAYING THINGS ABOUT DENKO AND ME THEN I’LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU  
I’LL FIND YOU I SWEAR  
  
###2ch  
Eep…  
  
###2ch  
Oh bajeezus.  
I know he’ll do it, too.  
  
###2ch  
uh  
  
  
uh  
  
###2ch  
i peed a little  
  
###2ch  
There was no (´･ω･`)…  
  
GUYS HE’S SERIOUS!!!  
  
##OP  
Do you really know Denko?  
If you really know her, tell me what she was wearing to the flower-viewing! (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
Say, if Denko filed a stalker report, is it likely this guy would get arrested?  
  
###2ch  
Very likely, surely?  
If this guy gets ignored, then law enforcement is a joke when it comes to stalking.  
  
###2ch  
This would all be seriously traumatic to almost any girl, especially a fragile one.  
OP still doesn’t seem to understand the ramifications of his actions.  
Maybe we should get a hold of people nearby to file a claim for Denko.  
  
###2ch  
So in short, OP stalked Denko and is getting bullied for it, but is acting like he’s the victim?  
  
###2ch  
^ Yes sir.  
  
##OP  
I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I do know karate.  
I really don’t like violence…  
But this might be my chance to overcome my traumas… (´･ω･`)  
It’s this or put up with it for two months…  
  
###2ch  
Where are you getting two months from?  
  
##OP  
I was advised here that if I endured it for two months, it would go away. (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
What’re your plans for today, OP?  
  
##OP  
Wondering if I should go to school or not… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
Why can’t you tell us a straight cause for the bullying?  
Are you just going to keep saying “rumors”??  
  
###2ch  
So, she didn’t like the thing at the flower-viewing, did she?  
  
##OP  
Apparently not… I can’t take any more wounds.  
Just seeing “Denko” makes me feel like my chest is being carved out of me…  
  
###2ch  
Hey, stop making fun of OP, okay!!  
Can you say everything you want to talk about, OP?  
About the cause for bullying, the rumors you haven’t specified about, about Denko…  
We’ll talk it all out with you. Okay?  
  
##OP  
Sniff… Thank you…  
I’m glad there’s a few good people… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
You goddamn… Were you threatening Denko with violence?  
  
Not saying anything to guys and threatening women? You’re the worst.  
What a waste of space. It’s obvious why you’re being bullied.  
  
##OP  
WHAT I WASN’T THREATENING HER (´･ω･`)  
I just grabbed her, okay?  
If you’re that guy from school, please don’t talk about this anymore…  
  
###2ch  
You got in an argument with Denko, grabbed her arm, and groped her. You’re a piece of shit is what you are.  
  
###2ch  
^ Hooray, Denko’s friend!  
  
##OP  
Whoa, wait, I let go right away… I didn’t grope her! (´･ω･`)  
Everyone, please, don’t let this guy lead you astray.  
  
###2ch  
Do you honestly think you’re convincing anyone at this point?  
  
###2ch  
You damn liar! Don’t use your stupid-ass emoticon with me! You gonna do something about that attitude problem?!?  
  
###2ch  
Hear it from me, guys. This guy says he’s being bullied in college, but in reality he’s a sack of shit who Denko loathes for chasing her around, and he sees the situation as him being goddamn bullied. He’s the epitome of creepy stalkers.  
  
##OP  
If I talk more about the flower-viewing, it’ll agitate the situation!  
All your name-calling is really hurting me…  
I want you to promise you won’t make fun of me.  
It’s a really delicate situation, so I don’t want things to get worse, or I’ll go nuts… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
Too late.  
  
###2ch  
Don’t be ridiculous.  
You don’t want to “agitate” things by talking about the flower-viewing? There’s nothing more that needs to be said! You’re just going to be a little shit who won’t apologize to Denko. Don’t ever come near her again!  
  
###2ch  
^ Whoa, calm down. Can you tell us if something happened?  
There’s no sense in getting angry.  
  
##OP  
Whoa, everyone’s so nice…  
I’ve never had so many people be this nice to me before… (´･ω･`)  
  
##OP  
Ohh, I’m scared…  
But I’ll write it now… I’m so glad there are so many people supporting me… (´･ω･`)  
Um, after the stuff happened, I got called by “A-ko,” who was headed to Yoyogi Park as planned.  
But the place was pretty large, so I couldn’t find the place she told me to go to.  
All she wrote that it was a hilly place in Yoyogi Park…  
  
##OP  
But eventually I found the hilly place, and of course Denko was there.  
I watched with a telescope and waited for a chance when she wouldn’t see me.  
I thought A-ko was going to have Denko go to the store, but she suddenly said she wouldn’t do it unless I paid an additional 30,000 yen.  
So of course I promised I’d pay 30,000 more, and she sent Denko to the store alone.  
There was a road for bikes near where Denko was, but Denko looked toward me for some reason, and I unconsciously got down on the ground… (´･ω･`)  
  
##OP  
Sorry for going off-topic. (´･ω･`)  
So then Denko found me on the cycling road.  
She looked back my way once or twice.  
Then she ran with incredible speed toward me while I was squatting!  
And I thought “Huh? Maybe I’ve cleared up the misunderstandings?”, stood up immediately, and waved at Denko as she ran toward me.
