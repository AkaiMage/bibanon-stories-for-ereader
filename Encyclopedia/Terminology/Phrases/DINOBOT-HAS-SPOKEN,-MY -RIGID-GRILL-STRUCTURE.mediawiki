: This began on Usenet in 1997 with a Transformers fan who used the name Dinobot. His .sig file was
:: "Dinobot has spoken. My rigid grill structure is coming in on your unprotected cargo door- Tom Servo Riding with Death"
Intended to be parsed like so:
::[blah blah, post would go here.]
::Dinobot has spoken.

::"My rigid grill structure is coming in on your unprotected cargo door" --Tom Servo, ''Riding with Death''
: Memory being what it is, the first line got associated with the first part of the MST3K quote and ended up becoming quite the [[meme]] in Transformers circles, ending up being used in several fan fics. At BotCon98 a group of fans even got the voice actor for Dinobot to say the line in a suggestive manner. Often when the origin of something is unclear it is assumed to be a sexual innuendo, and for a while this quote was no exception.
