'''NEVER FORGET''' (often posted as '''NEVAR FORGET''') is a parody of the numerous [[macros]] and videos seen containing the phrase in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. On [[4chan]], any [[:Category:Notable Events|notable event]] (be it awesome or an epic failure) can produce a "Never Forget" line. Often the 9/11 parody is carried further by including the date of the event (for example, [[Pool's Closed]] might be referenced in the form of "7/12 NEVER FORGET"), but the name of the event is also frequently used, as is the case in "20 Minutes".

== 20 Minutes ==
'''20 Minutes''' was created after [[child pornography]] was posted on [[4chan]]'s [[/b/]] and stayed there for 20 minutes before [[moderators]] got around to removing it. The thread rose like a rocket to over a hundred posts. It was common for child pornography posts to go on for 45 minutes or longer in the Spring and Summer of 2006.
