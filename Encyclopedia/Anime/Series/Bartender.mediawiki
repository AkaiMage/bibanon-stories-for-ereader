'''Bartender''' (バーテンダー) is a Japanese anime television series.  It is one of the best anime in the known universe, along with [[Musashi Gundoh]] and [[Rozen Maiden]]. The main character, '''Ryu Sasakura''' (佐々倉溜, ''Sasakura Ryuu''), works at a bar in the back streets of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginza Ginza] named Edenhall.

== Story of Bartender ==
The bartender of this series is actually '''Azuma Kazuma''', aged (pun intended) in his late twenties. The protagonist of the Ja-Pan epic Yakitate!! Japan lost his ability to create new, innovative bread types and ultimately lost his battle against Japanese tastes, then succumbed to alife of alcohol and drugs. As he lived out this path to destruction, he also partially lost his solar hands, being unable to reclaim any glory he previously had in the field of bread. However, during this dark period of this life, he found that his solar hands' abilities were not completely extinguished; his native abilities led to success when he tried his shot at working as a bartender, and the receptive public (who did not know about his depressing past) dubbed his drinks "God's Glass". In this anime series, Azuma Kazuma (never referenced directly by this name, taking on an alias) aids others' problems in life by providing a compassionate ear and a godly drink; it is a memorable, healing anime where, by hepling others face their own respective problems, he himself gains confidence and is able to face the remorse he holds for his own past.
