The '''Child Abduction''' [[meme]] was created in [[/b/]] when a /b/tard posted a picture of his television with a picture of Bender from Futurama on the screen, which displayed the words "Child Abduction" as closed caption text. The picture was an instant hit and resulted in hundreds of [[shoops]] all over [[4chan]], including Bender attacking different children with the words "Child Abduction" pasted on. The [[shops]] were not limited to Bender and included many other people that might be considered "child abductors," e.g. [[Cockmongler]]. It turns out the "Child Abduction" text was sent out by an Amber Alert and wasn't a closed captioning error as the OP previously thought.
