Plot armor is derisive term used for any instance where a character emerges victorious (or even just survives) in a way that should be impossible, solely because the plot calls for this to happen and with little or no explanation. The term is also used to describe characters, such as [[/co/#Goddamn Batman|Batman]] and [[/m/#Jesus Yamato|Kira Yamato]], who are believed by some to have benefit excessively from plot armor.
