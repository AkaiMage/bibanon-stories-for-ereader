*Projects are what we call implemented ideas.*

## General

* [[Project Mayhem]] - [[Anonymous]]'s project to create a better way for whistleblowers to submit data, rather than relying on the central servers or survivatory blackmail of [[Wikileaks]].
* [[CJDNS]] - Not a DNS system, but something more like a global distributed VPN... (somebody make a better description). It's part of the Meshnet project.

## Software

* [[Earthquake in a Box]] - A bundle of applications and guides to help anons and netizens thrive on the darknet.
* [[Firekips]] - A Tor Browser Bundle based browser designed to quickly introduce users to go on I2P, Tor, and Freenet.
