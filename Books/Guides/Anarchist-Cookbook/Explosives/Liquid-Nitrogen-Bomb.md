## Prelude

For you people that like blowing things up and shit like that, here's
something that's not as dangerous or as difficult as more of the explosives
available (or able to create)... It's called the LN2 Bomb (Short for Liquid
Nitrogen Bomb). Very easy to make:

### Ingredients

* 1 Plastic Two Litre Bottle
* Enough Liquid Nitrogen To Fill The Bottle

### Instructions:

Fill the bottle with liquid nitrogen. Then cap
as tightly as possible. The vaporization of the
nitrogen will create enough pressure in the
bottle (within 5-15 minutes) to break it with
a quite strong explosive force... Very Easy...

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK....
