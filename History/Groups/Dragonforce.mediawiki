A continually debated band on the [[/mu/]] board. Known for their very fast style of music ("power/action metal"), they are usually dismissed as crap by the musical elitists of /mu/, and are ridiculed for hiding the fact that they cannot actually play melodies with super-fast solos and riffs (by recording the guitars at slow speed and then speeding the music up digitally on a computer). Some hate them for the sole reason that they are now popular with emo children. Although they are the fastest metal in the world, they are being debated with Manowar as the hardest metal.
