'''IT'S A TRAP''' is a meme based on the line by Admiral Ackbar in ''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi''; started on [[Fark]] around 2002, and spread to the rest of the [[internet]] over a period of years, before ending up on [[/b/]].

'''IT'S A TRAP''' took on a new meaning, being used in response to pictures of men who appear to be women, degenerating into [[IT'S A TARP]] (and likely used with some new [[shops]]). It then gave birth to the terms [[trap]] and [[reverse trap]], referring to cross-dressers (of trans people) who convincingly look like the opposite of their original gender.
