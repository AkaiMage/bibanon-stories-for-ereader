Sarafan was an important sysop of [[Wikichan]]. One of his primary contributions was the tireless archival of certain important 4chan stories and copypasta. Without that hard work, we would never have even known about [[Damaged Goods]] or [[Blindmute Loli]].

Many rapidshare files that included important portions of Wikichan content (such as the original thread dumps and artwork from [[Damaged Goods]]) were lost due to it's deletion policy. Since Sarafan made a secret [[Megaupload]] archive (which is also gone, but I have a copy) that contained all these rapidshares, the story of [[Damaged Goods]] can be restored to it's original glory.
