And now, for some particularly uninteresting conversation.

---

A week last Tuesday I heard a knock on my door, 1:30 am in the morning no less. 

"Yeah yeah," I shouted as the knocking continued. 

"Hold on a minute will ya? I'm not answering my door in my boxers."

So I pulled on some jeans I found on the floor and took a cigarette out of the carton next to my bed, I came to the door expecting it to be my best friend turning up drunk as he has done a few times wanting a place to crash, but instead it was a small blonde. 

I didn't get a good look at her face as she pushed right past me and into my door, as she walked towards my livingroom she said in a muttered, teary tone "Please close the door anon he might have been following me".

I thought about it for a moment and closed the door, whatever her problem, it was going to be a long fucking night.

### 1229591 (OP)

I hesitated before entering my front room, I hadn't been awake 5 minutes and this was a lot to take in all at once, but since this thing has already been set in motion I let out a sigh, peeled the cigarette from my lip and licked my lips before putting it back in, lit it and entered my front room.

The blond girl was facing the door as I walked in and I raised an eyebrow upon realizing who it was.

"Been a long time... almost 7 years in fact, never thought I'd see you again.". 

She hesitated before speaking, her eyes farting around, seemingly looking for some words as I stood leaning on the doorframe staring at her, she clasped her hands together and looked down and muttered something to herself before looking up at me and saying; 

"Sorry to barge in Daniel, but I had nowhere else to go... can I stay here tonight? Please?".

I smiled, taking the cigarette from my mouth and saying "Well this is nice, not a word in over 7 years and now you come here asking for a free room? I have a pretty good memory and last time we talked I believe it was you who threw me out, why shouldn't I do the same thing to you?"

She looked up at me through her fingers, and choking back tears she uttered "Please... I don't have anywhere else... please let me stay...", Feeling a hint of remorse I sighed and sat down on the couch opposite, taking the ashtray into my hands and sitting back.

"From the beginning... why are you here? I'll let you stay for one night if it's good enough, if it's a falling out with your boyfriend or whatever you can leave now, I'm not interested in getting caught up in your new lovers quarrels"

She said nothing for a moment and just sat sobbing, part of me felt for her but that part was small compared to the seething hatred I bore for this woman... I flicked some ash into the ashtray on the coffee table and waited, then she began to speak.

### 1229595

Well this already sounds interesting. You have my attention anon, carry on...

### 1229622

I wish this were your real life anon, you seem like a movie quality lifestyle kinda guy.

### 1229711 (OP)

"I... Look, I know it's been a long time Daniel... and I'm really sorry for coming here, I know you wouldn't have wanted to see me again after what happened, but I know you're a good person and this was the last place I could turn to, you're the only one who could help me now...", tears began streaming from her eyes as she began to sob again her body shook. 

I tried to keep myself calm and treat her with the contempt she deserved for her past deeds, but my compassionate side got the better of me and I stood up and walked out of the room, returning with 2 glasses, a bottle of wine and the carton of cigarettes from my room. 

I poured myself a glass and placed it on my side of the coffee table before setting the bottle down next to her followed by the glass, I took my lighter from my pocket and flicked it over to her side of the table, she took her hands away from her face and looked up at me.

"I know you don't smoke anymore but I'm not going to get anything out of you while you're sitting there mumbling into your hands, pour yourself a glass too, it'll ease you up a little."

She poured herself a glass of wine and took a cigarette from the carton before looking up at me, I looked back at her and waited, she took out a cigarette, lit it and took a drag before coughing violently.

"Fuck me," (not literally?) I lamented as I leaned over and took the cigarette from her fingers, "Forget the cigarettes, just drink, it'll stop your throat burning", she polished off the glass quickly and caught her breath, still tensed up she looked towards me before apologizing and looking down at her feet. I was about to tell her to get on with it before she started speaking again, "He beats me" she said, the words rushing out of her mouth as she shook, "Tonight he came home drunk and ripped my pyjama top off, when I woke up and struggled he put his hands around my neck, I bit his arm to make him let go and he caught my hair when I tried to run away..."

### 1229749 (OP)

She started sobbing hard again, tears rolling from the cracks between her fingers, I was taken back by this for a moment before swallowing and rubbing my head with my free hand... swallowing my emotions I muttered "So have you called the police? Why didn't you go back to your moms house, why here?"

"She poured herself a tall glass of wine and washed it down again, slamming the glass on the coffee table haphazardly, her hands shaking "Because nobody wants to hear it! I've told the police and they couldn't do anything! I tried but I was too scared of what he would do to me! I looked on the internet and only a small amount of assult charges from domestics are ever convicted! If he got out he would kill me! and my MOM!? YOU REMEMBER MY MOM DANIEL! SHE COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT ME! I've TRIED telling her but she says I'm being ridiculous! I can't tell my friends because they all like him and it would get back to him! You're the only... person I know who has nothing to do with any of it..."

"So what?" I said as I leaned back on the sofa, "Call me because I'm the only one you can hide behind?"

"No. That's not it!"

"Then what do you want me to do? for all I know this is a pack of lies, why should I help you? In fact, why should I even trust you after what you did?"

Her eyes widened as she started shaking again, sobbing loudly... I felt bad but that feeling was stifled by the words I'd just said, she tore me a new one 7 years back, I don't owe her anything, if anything she owes me, why should I give a shit what happens to her?

"Well?" I said, the aggressive tone in my words as present as before, "... Did you think I'd welcome you here? Do you even remember what you did? All the pain you caused?"

### 1229767

>I've told the police and they couldn't do anything! 
>only a small amount of assault charges from domestics are ever convicted

I'm calling bullshit on your story.

If a women calls the cops that her husband/boyfriend or any random man is beating her he will be in jail by the end of the hour, whether he actually did it or not.

### 1229772

>>1229767

I think he may have been referring to actual prison time.

### 1229783

>"Yeah yeah" I shouted as the knocking continued "Hold on a minute will ya? I'm not answering my door in my boxers"

Story was confirmed bullshit right there, but the writing isn't that bad. Go on by all means.

### 1229795 (OP)

All my words did was make her sob louder, I checked myself and took a deep breath, holding it in for a moment and letting it all out slowly... Getting angry isn't going to do this situation any good, even so, I'm not apologizing... 

I should be allowed to be eternally pissed at her for what she did, but this wasn't the time or place for that, I always imagined the score between us would be settled on a mountain top with katanas and yellow jumpsuits, why not after all? 

In my mind it stood just as much chance of happening as any other chance to settle the score between us, in other words, never, but here she was at her weakest I've ever seen her, sobbing into her hands... my mind could have followed that train of thought forever but she stood up and began to unbutton her coat, that moment of silence must have given her a chance to think, she set her coat down over the back of the sofa and revealed a stripy pair of pyjamas, she began unbuttoning that too as she turned her back to me... 

As the top fell to her arms I saw all I needed to see... deep blue bruises, cuts, scratches, and a particularly bad bruise down her lower left back, as if she had been hit by a chair or bar, she had her eyes closed as she turned to face me... her stomach was way worse than her back, there were big patches of blue and yellow patches all around where old ones had begun to heal, cuts around her naval, particularly bad bruising around her collar bone, she was telling the truth, by the looks of it all it had been going on for months.

"he never hits anywhere anyone can see..." she muttered, looking down at her feet, "I can show you my legs too... they're much worse than..." and she began to cry again, I felt like an asshole sitting there witnessing that after all the mouth I just gave her.

### 1229843

There is no fucking way the cops would let that man keep walking after seeing injuries like that.

### 1229858 (OP)

I buried my face in my hands, the ash dropping onto the sofa as I rubbed up and down trying to find some words.

"... wait there" I said getting off the sofa and walking towards the door, I walked into my bedroom and pounded my fists on my bed as I sat down for a moment. 

"What to do..." I thought to myself, "Like I can be angry at her now... look at the fucking state she's in..." I gave myself a moment, gritting my teeth at the fact that even with all the anger and hostility I hold for her, I could never bring myself to do even 1 percent of what this guy has done to her... she looks fucking awful and it's quite obvious she's been through hell, if I did anything now it's tantamount to kicking a man... or woman, while she's down, and that isn't my style.

As much of an asshole I'd like to believe I am I draw the line at beating the living shit out of a 100lb 5'2 woman, the realization that even if she did fight back, we're talking about a girl who couldn't tenderize a steak, much less hold her own against a grown fucking man just made my blood boil... 

After a while I decided I'd have to swallow my hatred until this matter was resolved, and with that I went through my draws, picking out a ratty old band T-shirt and some green jogging bottoms, a towel and a pair of boxers, just in case... after being gone for around 15 minutes I returned to the livingroom and she turned to face me, her cheeks sore from the tears... 

I dumped the pile of clothes and the towel next to her and said "Shower and change... it'll make you feel a bit better, I'll sort you out some bedding." she silently took the pile into her arms and headed to the bathroom, saying thanks as she passed, I got to work finding my sleeping bag that I could unzip and give to her to use as a blanket.

### 1229918 (OP)

When she emerged from the bathroom she had changed into my spare clothes, I leaned out of the kitchen and down the hall and muttered "My bedroom, hairdryer 4th draw on the left, it's already plugged in just flick it on." She nodded and made her way into my bedroom with her hair in a towel, in the kitchen I'd made some hot chocolate, not strictly for her benefit as I fancied it, but I made enough for two and set one down on the coffee table.

I'd pushed towards the wall in the livingroom so I could join the 2 sofas together to make a makeshift bed. As she came into the room with her hair freshly blowdried. I turned the timer lamp on along with the HiFi system and pointed towards the hot mug of cocoa, "Don't worry about the lamp, from what I remember you didn't like like dark too much, it'll go off eventually by itself. Sorry about the pillows, they're a little old but they're the only spare set I have, it's all clean though..." 

"Thank you.." she said quietly as I put my hand on the light switch, I turned to the door and flicked the lights off

"Drink up and try and get some sleep, you'll be alright."

"Goodnight," She said quietly, sitting down on her makeshift bed, taking the cocoa into her hands, "night" I said as I closed the door and make my way into my bedroom.

I lay on my bed awake for what felt like hours, the events of the night clashing against the past in my mind, not knowing how to feel about all of this... one side of me wanted to march in there and throw her out on the streets, remembering what she did to me she would have more than deserved it, the other side of me telling me to be the bigger man and give her a break until this thing was over, I closed my eyes and tried to calm myself... after all, whether I liked it or not nothing was going to get resolved that night...

### 1229976 (OP)

Whatever I tried I couldn't sleep, I've never been one for sleeping in the covers so I tossed and turned on top of them every so often hunting for the cool spots, trying to get back to sleep... eventually I heard something, it was quiet... 

I listened intently and it sounded like wimpering... 

I tried to ignore it but I couldn't and with a mumbled "fuck me..." (though not in that way)

I got up and went for a piss before stopping in my tracks in the hallway to see if she was still at it, she was... so I took a deep breath and opened the door, it was pitch black inside, the lamp had gone off... I whispered "Still awake?", I heard a muffled "mmhmm" as she sniffled... 

I turned the dimmer right down before hitting the light switch as to not blind her with the light and there she was under the blankets, as I walked towards her she sat up to reveal damp patches on the pillow where the tears had sunk though, telling me she had been at it for a while.

### 1230062 (OP)

I took my cigarettes off the coffee table and asked her if she wanted a cup of tea, she nodded, I walked out of the room and put the kettle on before walking though my bedroom and onto the balcony, with a lit cigarette I sat down cross legged staring through the bars at the cityscape, it was obvious I wasn't going to get any sleep now... 

I'd probably have to call in sick to work as well while I sorted out this blast from the past shitheap than had been shoved onto my plate... as much anger as I was feeling over the whole thing I couldn't ignore that little voice in my head telling me to have some compassion.

I sat there as the cold january winds whistled around my body wondering what the fuck I should do next, sitting there like that usually gave me a few answers but tonight it was turning up nothing, and who could blame it? 

"This isn't exactly a typical Tuesday night problem," I thought to myself. "I guess getting her to sleep is first on the list, if she sits and cries like that I won't get back to sleep anyway.", as the cigarette burned down the the filter I stood up and spat it out over the balcony railing and headed back inside to the warmth of my bedroom, then through to the kitchen as I made a pot of tea. Then with that, 2 mugs, a little bottle of milk and the sugar pot I made my way into the livingroom. 

She was still sitting up with that sad expression on my face as I set the tray down on the coffee table, "Take it the way you did before?" I said, pouring the tea into the mug, "Yeah..." she said, "2 sugars, 1 drop of milk" I thought to myself as I made her tea and handed it to her, I made mine and climbed onto the sofa-bed before sitting down cross legged at the far side where her feet were, we sat in silence while we sipped away searching for words...

### 1230093 (OP)

Until finally she broke the silence with "... I don't know what I'm going to do Daniel... by now he's noticed I'm gone and he's probably gone ballistic, he's probably looking for me..." 

I sat my mug down in the palm of my hand in my lap, "Does he know about this place?" I asked, looking at her. 

"No... I never told him about you..." I thought for a second before asking a question I should have asked right at the start. 

"Who told you my address anyway? I don't remember giving you my contact details..."

She looked up at me and said "Promise not to get mad?"

"No. But I'd still like to know, don't tell me you 192'd my ass." 

She grimaced as she rubbed the side of her mug, "I've known for a while... I found it online,,," I raised my eyebrows in that "mmm, thought so" way, "As long as you didn't ask my parents or friends or anything... I'd have been pissed if they were so fast to give my address to you of all people", she looked down at the mug and stayed completely silent for a moment, then, not looking towards me at all I saw a tear drop into her tea... 

"... You never did forget what I did, did you...", as she said those words I had to surpress my inner demon from getting out and blowing up, I've suppressed my rage towards her for so many years... it's hard to keep it bottled when the person who wreaked so much havoc and caused so much pain in your life is right there in front of you... 

It took me a moment to compose myself and make sure I wouldn't explode at her. "No..." I said , my deep tone just barely hiding my anger "I couldn't..."

### 1230131 (OP)

She stayed silent, when she breathed in I could hear the staggered pattern of her inhaling, she was obviously still suppressing her urge to cry, as she breathed out she took the mug to her lips and finished the tea, then leaned over the arm of the sofa and set it down on the floor, then she looked to me and said:

"Please listen to me... I need you to promise me you won't blow up Daniel, please promise you'll try to listen?", again I had to give myself a moment to make sure I could keep my feelings in check, when I was confident I could. 

I nodded and said "Okay... but if I tell you to stop, you stop, got it?", she nodded as she fiddled with her fingers, trying to organize her thoughts, probably in a fashion that wouldn't tip me over the edge and cause me to explode into a fit of rage as she spoke, then looking up a few times to check if I was ready to receive it, she began "You probably don't want an apology after all this time... --

### 1230248 (OP)

-- But I want to apologize... I've wanted to for a long, long time... I took so much from you back then, and I can see the pain I caused is still there now, I tried so hard to say I was sorry but I was scared... I heard through people how angry you were, I heard that you were in hospital because of how I made you feel... I was terrified of ever seeing you again..." 

I gritted my teeth as I looked down into my mug, half concentrating on the low music coming from the hifi, trying to use it to take my mind off of the memories that were rushing into my head with every word. 

"-- If I wasn't backed into a corner as much as I am now I doubt I'd ever have been in a position to explain myself as I am now, and even now I'm scared any moment you're going to..." 

She let out a sigh as a tear rolled down her cheek, she continued with a fearful tone "I manipulated you, I knew you loved me and I used your feelings against you... I stole from you, I hid things from you... I went behind your back... I--" She took a deep breath, choking on her tears, by now my brow was ruffled and I couldn't stop my face from showing my anger. 

I did my best to hear her out, even as my teeth were clenched together and my mind blanked, my eyes lost focus as feelings of rage swept up and down my body, I stopped myself from moving or speaking, intently listening to her every word, 

"I lied and stole from your family, I made you take stupid risks for my sake and I used you Daniel... I'm a fucking terrible person!!" 

With that she burst into a full fledged, loud sobbing, I sat there taking it all in, trying my very best not to react, waiting for her to finish, every single word was like her twisting the knife in my old wounds.

## 1230323 (OP)

The very fact that she knew what she was doing only amplified my rage to a level I'd never felt before, never had I wanted to let go and take out my anger on anyone so much, the only thing stopping me was the fact that if I did I probably wouldn't be able to stop and I'd loose everything I'd built in the last 7 years for one flash moment of revenge... 

Instead I sat, seething in anger as she sobbed, waiting for her to speak... After her emotional outburst, she composed herself enough and continued:

"I'm so sorry for what I did to you... I had absolutely no reason to do the things I did, I knew you loved me so much... I know you hate me now and I deserve to be hated... I still can't believe you haven't thrown me out of your home... I know this isn't enough to make up for what I did, not even a little bit... But I'm sorry Daniel... if you'll let me, I'll try to make it up to you even if it takes me years. I don't expect you to forgive me for what I did..."

I sat there brooding, She caught a glimpse of my expression and shuffled backwards a little as I lefted my head, tears around my cheeks, my teeth clenched, eyes fixed on her like a beast and my hands pressing so tightly clenched around my mug it felt like I could shatter it, I felt the growl as I spoke.

"You don't even know the half of it do you... What I've had to do because of you, what I've been through, thanks to you I haven't trusted anyone in years... because of what you did to me, I've not even been able to so much as think about it without feeling sick to my stomach, take your half-assed apology and shove it up your ass, you're right, I don't want it... Until tonight I'd have been happy with never seeing your face again but here you are... you want to do me a favor?" 

I took a cigarette from my pocket and lit it, and stared at her "Shut up and never say you're sorry again, don't even speak about it"

## 1230445 (OP)

We sat in silence for a while, I listened to the radio as I let my feelings settle, the near-silence lasted for ages as she sat staring down at her lap. 

Eventually she said "Can I ask... Why don't you say my name?", the anger flashed inside my chest again as I thought about her question, "... Because it hurts to even be reminded of you. Thats why, I cringe every time I hear it, even on the news or in a song".

"oh..." she said, another string of tears running down her cheek, "Should I go?", I thought about it for a second as I flopped my head over the back of the sofa, "No... As much as I hate you, you're not leaving... and if you really want to start making it up to me, you'll stay put, I can't stand the thought of throwing you out because that would make me as bad as you were." 

I smiled as I let a puff of smoke out of my mouth, still staring at the dim lights on the ceiling "There's plenty of time for the score to be settled between us" I thought to myself "Maybe all of this will help me get over the past... but again, nothing is going to get resolved tonight".

I sat up on the chair again and looked at her, "Do you have a job?", she nodded, "Are you working tomorrow?", she shook her head, "No... not until monday."

"I see... well... do you have any plans tomorrow?", she hesitated before opening her mouth, "N-No... I was planning on figuring out what I'm going to do... I can't go back there... and he'll have already told my mom I ran away..."

## 1230539 (OP)

"... If he catches me..." she muttered under her breath, "He won't..." I said, staring at her, "Tomorrow we're going to get your stuff, is he a big man?", she shook her head "No... just stronger than me...", "Good... if I'm doing this I'm be damned if I'm going to get the shit kicked out of me", She looked at me wide eyed, and fiddled with the blanket, "You're...?"

"Yeah. But in return you're going to make good on what you said, starting tomorrow you're paying me back for every little thing you stole from me, throwing you out means throwing out the opportunity to make you pay for what you did, thats only fair."

She looked at me and nodded, biting her lip to keep herself from smiling, "You're apologizing to my family too, and paying them back. but we'll do this one step at a time...", she hesitated before nodding slowly, "four thousand four hundred and sixty two pounds... and that only covers what you stole financially..."

I thought to myself, "I'm going to make it impossible for you to screw me over again, you better be ready.", I looked at her and said "Think you can get to sleep now? Because the suns going to be on the rise soon", she nodded and I picked myself up and jumped off the sofa and onto the floor, as I went to walk past her and out of the room she grabbed my hand and looked up at me, then said "Thank you.", I took my hand away and paused, then said "Get some sleep, you're going to have a long day tomorrow"

## 1230601 (Q&A)

I'm taking a break, to address some issues:

- It's a true cool story bro
- It takes a long time because I'm having to sit and remember it all, that and I keep having a smoke and making more coffee, I've got all weekend for this particularly cool story, it's dragging on because I'm trying to put you guys in my shoes and follow how I thought and spoke. 

That's good storytelling, if you want me to greentext it all I could do it all in one post but that would completely fuck the idea of a cool story

Questions so far? I wont tell you anything that will spoil the next parts.

## 1230728 (OP)

I went to bed and went out like a light and woke up the next day around noon, as I tiptoed into my livingroom I saw her sprawled out over the sofas hugging the sleeping bag like a sad japanese man hugging a body pillow, "Thats... nostalgic." I thought to myself, closing the door again and heading into the shower, I pressed my hands against the tiles as the water poured over me thinking about what happened last night... today was going to be a long day and over half of the daylight had already been spent sleeping, I winced at the thought of not calling in sick for work in time and mentally prepared for my boss to chew my ass off, but a saying "I was up all night" 

Wouldn't exactly be a lie, even if the rest of it would be, jumping out of the shower I brushed my teeth and took a new one out of the bathroom drawer, "If I was a petty man I'd make her pay for that too..." I thought to myself before shaking it off and wrapping a towel around myself, "Welp, I hope I still have those body pads somewhere... if tonight goes how I think it will I'd like to come away with as few bruises as possible... then again any man who knocks women around probably won't have the balls to take on a man my size... but still."

As I was getting dressed I found them, body pads are used in contact sports for practice at some gyms and back when I was a gym rat I went for a few classes, didn't learn anything and stuck to the irons instead, I felt a little remorseful over my giving up so soon as, like I thought before, if tonight goes how I think it will, those skills probably would have come in handy... still, no point complaining about that now.

## 1230731 (OP)

I put them on and felt a little silly about it, so I put on some baggy cargos and a black tank top under my t-shirt, then put a shirt over that left open... I got the urge to take them off as I felt like a wuss, but managed to convince myself to keep them on, even if it just prevented him from knocking the wind out of me or taking my down by booting the back of my leg, the extra little bit of resistance would probably be worth it... I slipped my trainers on, dried my hair with the hairdryer and went into the kitchen to make some coffee, as I did so a small figure appeared from the livingroom door, peering around the kitchen threshold.

"Morning" I said without turning around "Go and grab a shower, I've left a towel and some more clothes for you in there, we'll worry about getting yours back later"

## 1230845 (OP)

She shuffled into the bathroom as I went into the livingroom and put the sofas back and folded up her bedding, then I sat and thought about how we'd go about getting her things... 

I had cardboard boxes in the back of my wardrobe and a collapse-able carry crate under my bed, more than enough for her to put clothes and things into, I can't imagine her wanting much more than clothes, documents and other essentials, when she came in I asked her what she would want to get out of there, as she sat down she quietly said "um... not a lot, you could probably fit it all into a box..." 

"Would it fit in the back of my car?"
She looked taken back for a second, then went on to say "You drive?"

"Yeah, the blue Vauxhall Astra, it's right outside the flats, think it will fit?" She nodded as she sat and sipped, then for the next few hours we talked about how it would go down, she was confident that with me there he wouldn't try anything and she knew exactly what she wanted to take, all she would need to do is go up the the bedroom and into the kitchen to get her things, so keeping him in the livingroom would be the best way to deal with it all... 

Around 5pm we were ready to go and we got in the car, as we approached the place she shook nervously, her eyes fixed out of the car window watching the street lights, as the sat nav told me to turn on to her street she began fidgeting and breathing heavily, and just for a moment she looked at me with desperation in her eyes, like she wanted to just get the fuck out of there, but I was determined to start sorting out this mess and I was determined not to let her go back on her word or go back to this place... just picturing the bruises all over her made me WANT to smash his face in, I used that feeling as my resolve as we pulled up outside the place...

## 1230903 (OP)

and what a fucking dump it was... quiet as the street appeared to be there was that lingering feeling of being in a shitty neighborhood I thought I'd left behind when I moved out of the flat we shared 7 years ago, this place was exactly like that. 

It was a daunting feeling to say the least, but, popping a cigarette out of my carton in the center console and taking my shirt off to prevent it working against me in a struggle, I opened the car door and lit my cigarette, "NO!" she screamed as I went to get out of the car "Please! Can't we just go back to yours? I'll get new clothes and everything! I don't need any of it!", shifting myself into my battle mode mindset I looked at her and said "We're doing this. Get out of the car" and with that I grabbed the boxes from the boot and stared into the passenger side window from the pavement, waiting for her to get out.

When we did I asked her which door she was and she nervously and quietly said "3b", as soon as she said it I took a deep breath, flicked my cigarette and began walking towards the door, as we entered the building she stayed very close to my back and as we walked up the stairs I could hear her forcing every step as if she was carrying a 2 ton car on her shoulders, as I approached the door she clung to my back and I could feel her shaking which only added to my decision to get this done and go home, as I knocked I heard her wimper and with every little sound made inside she jerked violently as if she was expecting to get hit as soon as he opened the door.

OP I just wanted to say, that as far, you're acting very admirably. To be the bigger man, to withhold against such past history, to help a lady in distress.. Well, that's very impressive. Not so sure how to properly express it in English, but you seem like a very good admirable person. If that is making sense.

## 1230959
>>1230943
I believe that you meant to say "Gentleman".

## 1230982 (OP)

As the door opened a 5'7 fat man who looked rough as fuck stared back at me, then he looked around me to see her shaking behind me, "Wots this about?" he said, I could feel the "oh shit" feeling in his words as he looked me up and down, trying to act tough.

I stared at him for a moment, then said "I think you know what this is about mate, step aside and let her get her things and there won't be any trouble", he took a step back into the flat and grabbed the door, he tried to slam it in my face put using my arm to stop it slamming and jamming my foot in the threshold I stopped him closing and locking the door. 

"FUCK OFF!" he yelled "FUCK OFF OR I'M CALLING THE POLICE!" struggling against his weight I managed to shift my arm onto the side of the door, then I shoved myself against it with all my weight, forcing him backwards and the door wide open, I wasted no time in marching up to him and shoving him into the front room then I called back "NOW! GET IN AND GET YOUR THINGS! HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE!" 

He tried to shove me out of the way of the door but despite his weight his flabby weak arms prevented him from making me budge, he gritted his teeth at me and made a fist, as it came came towards me I knocked his arm to one side, grabbed him by his shoulders and shoved him as hard as I could sending him stumbling backwards onto the sofa behind him 

"SIT DOWN YOU FAT CUNT!" I yelled "YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T CAVE YOUR FUCKING FACE IN MATE! YOU THINK I ENT SEEN WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO HER!? GIVE ME A FUCKING EXCUSE YOU LUMP OF SHIT I DARE YOU!"

## 1231087 (OP)

He picked himself up off the sofa and came careering towards me again, I shifted myself forwards to catch him but the sheer weight of him forced me up against the door and he tried wrapping himself around me and using his weight to shift me sideways, completely enraged I grabbed him by the back of his head and drew my head back before landing the biggest glasgow kiss in the history of glasgow kisses, so impressive that even Billy Connolly would blush at the sight of it and with that he staggered backwards holding his nose which soon began to pour of blood.

He went to get up off the sofa again but this time I lunged forwards "TRY IT YOU CUNT, I FUCKING DARE YA!" He hesitated and faltered, staying put holding his nose, to my amazement he started to cry which was fucking ugly sight, I jeered at him, "Fat cunt..." I muttered under my breath, leaning with my back against the door, "Look at you... fucking pathetic, not so easy when you're dealing with a man and not a weak terrified little girl is it mate..." he went to get up again and again I lunged forward ready to counter him, he sat back on the chair and muttered "I'm calling the police when you leave... you're gonna get done."

I smiled and leered at him "Yeah, and so will you, I doubt she'll hesitate to prosecute you this time knowing that if you touch her again I'll be there", he muttered again "Not if you're in the nick, you can't protect her forever", This sent my blood boiling and I marched over to him, grabbing his shoulders and forcing his back to the sofa.

## 1231154 (OP)

Getting right in his face and looking right into his eyes, his arms flailed as my face grew closer, his fingers leaving prints of his nose blood on arms and a bit on my face, my teeth on full display, unable to compose myself I seethed at him "You so much as text that girl again and I'll be back, and I don't care if I go to prison... I WILL FUCKING. BURY. YOU..." 

I shoved my arms to push myself away from the sofa and took my place standing against the door again, staring at him until finally she said "I-I've got everything... can we go?"

"Yeah..." I said as I turned to the door "head down to the car and get in, I'll be down in a minute, if there's more than one box leave it by the door and I'll carry it down. I heard her shuffle out of the flat, and I stood and stared at him, counting in my head, watching for any movement other than his staggered breathing and wiping the blood off of his face.

## 1231244 (OP)

When the 60 seconds were up in my head I took a deep breath and turned towards the door, as I opened it he went to get up and I span round on the attack "STAY DOWN!" I shouted, he hesitated and sat back down, his face twisted at me, "... I know you're not stupid enough to follow me out mate... stay there and wait until the front door closes", I watched him for a moment, making sure he understood, then walked out of the door, picking up a box just outside of the entrance to the flat filled with clothes, shoes, books and an assortment of CDs and DVDs... as I started down the stairwell I heard the door slam loudly, I stopped and looked up making sure he wasn't stupid enough to follow me out and try and get the drop on me on the stairs, then continued down and out to the car, I put the box in the boot and made my way round to the drivers side before jumping in and starting the car, opening the window and lighting a cigarette, I looked over at her and she was wide eyed looking back

Yes, this word I mean is Gentleman. Why is not everybody have such honour?

## 1231382

"Blood..." She wimpered, staring at my shirt, then my face. "Yeah..." I said, then taking the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to say it, "... Don't worry, it's not mine", I smiled as I thought back on that part in die hard, pretty sure it was die hard 3. heh. then I shifted the car into gear and began to drive off... she was as quiet as a mouse all the way back, 

(sorry, went for a fag again, plus called for a pizza, it is friday night here after all)

## 1231386
>why is not anybody have such honour?

sorry my love, I just had to laugh at that.

Weeeeeeell, I believe that you call him a gentleman because he set aside his feelings of hate and showed compassion, that's difficult for everyone, and if anyone helps a lady in distress that person would be a gentleman in my opinion.

## 1231451

>>1231386

Sorry for my bad English, feel free to laugh :)

But what I am curious is for, is that a man should be thought of, as exceptional, for helping a lady. Should not every man do this? In Belarus, we do this, regardless. But, it is different in Western culture? This story is learning me much about such differences, in culture and in language.

We got out and carried the boxes up to my flat, his flat was the other side of the city so it took a while to get back, it was so quiet in that car on the way back I hardly noticed that she had been crying, but her cheeks were red and puffy which was a clear indication, that silence continued as we went in and set the boxes down in the livingroom, "There." I said.

"Thats the hard part over, now we just need to sort your life out..." She stood staring at me as tears began trickling down her face again, she started stumbling towards me, as she welled up and as she fell onto my chest she began bawling loudly, wrapping her arms tightly around my waist, I stood in complete silence.

I went to put my hands on her shoulders or embrace her, but I couldn't bring myself to do so... after all, I couldn't even stand saying her name, never mind comforting her... but I wasn't pushing her away either so I wasn't completely heartless, she stood sobbing into my chest for what felt like ages, "... I guess she see's this is the end of her nightmare." 

I thought to myself "Natural for her to get it all out I guess...", she looked up at me, I exhaled through my nose and stared back at her, then said "You hungry? I don't know about you but a shower and some food sound pretty good about now, I don't think I can answer my door to the curry man with blood on me after all", she smiled and loosened her grip.

"Blood on your forehead" I said, pointing to it. "You probably want to wipe that off, there's a small chance he might be retarded enough to call the police, you don't want to look like an accomplice to assault, you should dry your eyes too...", she looked up at me and grimaced before turning and walking into the bathroom, I followed and turned into my bedroom to pick out some shorts and a clean t-shirt, then called the curry house while she cleaned herself up in the bathroom.

## 1231561 (OP)

I undressed in my bedroom, taking my t-shirt off, then my tank top and finally the pads I laughed to myself "Some good these fucking things were, what the hell was I thinking?", I took them off and whimsically skimmed them under my bed, then took my shoes and cargos off and did the same for the thigh and shin pads.

"You out of the bathroom yet?" I called out. 

I heard a "Yes" from the livingroom. As I walked into the bathroom I said 

"If the curry man comes while I'm in here my wallet is on my desk in my bedroom, it should come to around 20 quid".

"Okay." came back and I jumped in the shower making sure to scrub my face well to get the pig blood off of me.

The curry man came as I was in there and I heard her pay and take the bag into the kitchen, when I came out she had already prepared the meal and was sitting down in the livingroom with the plates on the coffee table waiting for me, "Still need to dry my hair," I said as I peered into the room. "It's fine you can start without me", when my hair was dry I took a seat, leaned forward and started eating.

When the meal was over I took the plates into the kitchen and washed them up in the sink, stuffed and tired I took 2 ice cold beers out of the fridge and opened them, and placed one in her hands in the livingroom before flopping down onto the sofa... silence filled the room as we watched the news on TV, I smiled to myself fantasizing about me appearing on there; "Super badass crushes fat guys nose, ends string of domestic abuse, police now charging him with assault and battery, more on this at 10!"

### 1231651

These kind of stories are why /r9k/ is my favourite board and like >>1231538 said, op is more of a man (alpha) than all of r9k together, because helping someone, wether it's a guy,girl, ex gf, friend or what ever that has betrayed you in the way she betrayed him, have the heart and the balls to not flip out and throw that person out on the steets to die, is what makes you a real man. Not being a total douche.

## 1231617 (OP)

I looked over at her, she seemed to be deep in thought for a while before catching me staring. I huffed, gave a smirk and said "It's getting late... Go ahead and take a shower, at least now you can wear your own pyjamas right?", she smiled before getting up to go for her shower. 

Taking the oppourtunity that had presented itself I stretched out on the sofa letting my legs dangle from the side. Normally I'd sit on the sofa opposite but the small coffee table had forced me to sit next to her. I finished my beer and closed my eyes relaxing after a "job well done" and let out a big, loud roar as I yawned. I heard the water starting to run in the shower, then I drifted off for a while.

## 1231743 (OP)

When I came to she was sitting on the sofa opposite watching TV in a pair of soft pink formal-style pyjamas. "Classy," I thought to myself before sitting up and rubbing my eye. 

"How long?" I said. She looked over at me and said "Not long... about half an hour". "Shit" I said, standing up to stretch out. "I can never get to sleep after a nap".

I picked up the coffee table and placed it down before sliding it against the wall. "Cmon, it won't do either of us any good if we keep staying up, it'll just fuck up our sleeping patterns". With that she stood up and walked behind the sofa and together we pushed them into the same bed formation they were before. 

I took the sleeping bag and folded it out over the sofas and threw the pillows to the arm rests, then walked over to the lamp, set the timer and turned it on. "Do you want the radio on low like last night?" I asked. she nodded "Kerrang? Galaxy? BBC 1?", "Kerrang please" she said quietly, sitting down on her bed. "My ipod has some albums on it too, if you still have the same shitty taste in music as me just put it on shuffle and press the aux button in top." "Okay," she said as she nodded. I dimmed the lights right down again as I went to walk out of the room, as I grabbed the door handle she jumped off her bedding and made her way over to me, without warning she wrapped her arms around me again and pressed her face hard into my chest.

"Thank you..." she said quietly, "... I promise I'll make up for everything I did to you Daniel...", with that she squeezed and then let go standing back, "Night" I said as I began to step backwards out of the door, "Goodnight" she said back, and when that I closed the door, went into my bedroom and flopped down onto my bed face first.

## 1231882 (OP)

admittedly I found myself in a bit of a worry over what I'd done and whether he was stupid enough to try and press charges... "its our word against his... he says aggravated assault, I'll say self-defense and defending a friend who lived there, his side won't stand up in court, not after they see her bruises, if he can think as far as that he wouldn't dare, they'd eat a fattie like that alive in prison", I reassured myself with these thoughts... still not being able to sleep I decided to tip-toe into the kitchen and took a bottle of malibu out of the cupboard, then I went back into my bedroom and onto the balcony, broke the seal on the bottle and had a good long swig before lighting up a cigarette and leaning against the wall, my feet sticking through the railings... I sat there for ages trying to clear my head, staring out at the cityscape like the night before that, I took it easy but kept sipping the malibu, hoping to get drunk enough not to be able to drink so hard and eventually go to bed... before long I found myself staring out admiring the lights of the city centre, I heard the door creak open and a small familiar figure peer out, "Can't sleep either can you...", "No..." she said before taking a seat next to me, I picked up the bottle and offered it to her, she read the label slowly before taking a swig, coughing as her body tried to reject the strong taste of rum among the coconut, I smiled and said "If you don't drink it straight you're supposed to tell me... it's barely 20% proof... I'm guessing you're still not much of a drinker.", she composed herself before leaning on me, then she took another swig, this time calmly without gagging, then let out a loud sigh... "I don't know what I'm going to do..."

## 1232041 (OP)

"... well, if it's anything like getting kicked out, you're supposed to find a new address, tell your bank, place of work, DVLA and the passport office your new address, cancel any subscriptions you have at your old address... you get the idea", she looked toward me and gave a wry smile before looking out again, "... How did you find this place?", I took a swig before saying "Forget it, you're not going anywhere until you pay me back for starters, and thats probably going to take a few months... you can pay me back faster if we split the rent and bills between us... not thinking about going back on our deal are you?" "No." she said, with a serious tone "But thanks... that'll make it easier... do you mean I can live with you for a while?"
I thought about this carefully and took my time to gather the correct words... lets not forget I hate her after all, I didn't want her thinking that we were pals just because she came to me in her hour of need, after a while I said "Until you've paid me back... I don't want you going anywhere, so yeah, you can register here for now, we'll do the paperwork tenancy after I get back from work tomorrow, you can spend tomorrow sorting out your accounts and changing your addresses. deal?"
"Deal..." she said, staring out into the night sky, after a while I stood up and gestured for her to come in, I set the bottle and cigarettes down on my desk and stretched out on my bed, she sat down on the corner facing the door, it looked like she was trying to say something so I closed me eyes and waited, but nothing came of it... she stood up and with my eyes still shut I felt a tap on my forehead and she said goodnight and walked out of the door, I bought my fingers up and felt where she tapped, it was a little damp... "finger kiss" I thought to myself "If I'd saw it coming I'd have dodged it...", refusing to think about it any further I went to sleep.

## 1232334 (OP)

The next day I got up, showered, dressed and left for work without waking her up, I only left a note on the fridge that read "Change your addresses, help yourself to whatever you can find, I'll be going shopping before coming home tonight, be back around 7-8, remember your promise!", at work it was a pretty shitty day, like I thought my boss chewed the shit out of me in the morning briefing and I had to work twice as hard to catch up on my work, I was knackered by the time 5pm hit, I made my way to Lidl and did the shopping, then made my way back to the flat, when I came in she was sitting in the livingroom, paperwork out all over the coffee table with her netbook on her lap and her glasses on, "How did it go?" I said, walking into the kitchen to unpack, "I hope you don't mind Daniel, I had to use your printer to print out a new passport application and some other stuff"
"Nah, had to be done I guess" I said whimsically, "What do you want to eat?" I called out, I heard nothing for a moment, then "Umm... I have a discount code for papa johns pizza in my email, my treat tonight", "Err... Alright, sounds good" I called back, grabbing 2 beers from the fridge and setting one her side of the coffee table before lying down on the sofa opposite, swigging the bottle of beer in my hand, "Well I called my landlord for the forms, he's dropping them off on tuesday next week, he said it's fine to split the rent I'm paying now but needs you on the tenancy agreement for his insurance..." She looked over at me and smiled before facing back down to her laptop, "You still look weird in glasses you know, reminds me of how you looked in school..."
She simply nodded before saying "You want a hot pizza, no mushrooms?"
"Sounds good"
"Seee... I remembered!"

## 1232387 (OP)

I thought for a second, sat up to face her and said "Your favorite colour is Blue, your dogs name was Maurice, Your mothers name was Betty and she was a bitch, your favorite teacher was Mr. French, he taught music, your favorite Artist was Alliyah and your favorite band was Electric Blue Orchestra, Your favorite movie was Rush Hour 1, Your favorite position was reverse cowgirl, you have 4 moles, 1 on your ass, one on your leg, one on your back and one on the back of your neck, You've always wanted to visit Canada, Your favorite animal was the dolphin, you prefer dogs to cats, you're insecure about your height, size of your boobs and the fact that you put on weight around your waist first, your favorite type of beer is Coors, your favorite chocolate is Galaxy, Your best friend was... pheh, me I guess... oh, and your favorite meal treat was pizza, your favorite toppings being jalepinos, red onion and spicy ground beef... Your turn." She sat and stared at me for a moment smiling, then said "For someone who can't stand saying my name you sure remember a lot about me..." I sat up, took a swig of my beer, pulled out a cigarette, lit it and said "I used to love you remember? You can't forget those details so easily... I could keep going if you want me to..

## 1232541 (OP)

She adjusted herself, my last commented seemed to make her uncomfortable, she thought for a second, then began "Your favorite color is red, you never had any pets, your moms name was Fiona and your dads name was Stuart, your brothers name was Marcus and your sisters name was Lisa, you always wanted to visit Japan, your favorite teacher was erm... miss... B something, she taught World History and you fancied her for ages, your favorite food is Chicken Madras with rice and garlic naan, your favorite artist was either Tupac Shakur or Wu-Tang Clan, favorite movie was that Top Gun parody with Charlie Sheen in it, you have a massive scar on your chest from when your big brother pushed you off a garage roof when you was 14, you was in hospital for 2 months, your favorite chocolate was dark, I don't think you ever told me the brand... You're insecure about your weight too because you were fat when you were a teenager, your favorite beer is some german cloudy stuff, but you prefer spirits, irish whiskey I think... ... ... thats all I got", I was honestly impressed, although I wouldn't show it, to think she knew so much and have been capable of doing what she did... "Amazing" I thought to myself "... Well I guess she would have had to have known me at least that well to do what she did", I looked over at her unable to hide my smile, although that smile was there out of sheer disbelief, she took it as me being impressed and buried her head in her laptop again, "See..." she muttered

## 1232704 (OP)

I was about to say what I was thinking but I thought better of it, instead I took a few drags of my cigarette and drank my beer while she sat typing away, "So... has any of that changed?" She said, looking up while typing, I thought for a second, then said "Well... My favorite artist is Tupac, and my favorite beer is Belgian, not german... the movie is called hot shots and it's cadbury's bourneville... thats the name of my favorite chocolate, haven't had any in years... but yeah, otherwise pretty accurate on the stuff you can remember, what about you? Anything changed?", she sat and thought, then shook her head, "No, I don't think so... I have a mole on my bum?", I nodded, "Left cheek, just above where the cheek meets the back of your leg", she smiled and rolled her eyes, "Perv" she let out, getting back to work on her laptop, "Puh-lease... I know your body inside and out, I could write a manual for you.", she smiled and typed away until the doorbell rang and I bought in the pizza, as we sat down and ate she said "Cmon then, tell me all about my body", "No" I said, looking at the tv and picking up a slice "I'm not here to indulge you, the fact is I know and that's all there is to it"
"Alright, she said as she turned to the TV, one thing and I won't bother you about it again, something nobody knows except you"
I thought for a moment and chose carefully, waitiing for her to put a slice if pizza in her mouth, then I said "When you cum hard you make a sound like a rusty garden gate and you go cockeyed"

## 1232888 (OP)

She gagged on the slice, covering her mouth with her hand, throwing the half eaten slice back in the box, I grinned and squinted my eyes at her, then took a victory swig of my beer, when she managed to swallow he uttered "fucker!" under her breath, then she went on to say "I swear on my moms life, you're the only one who's ever made me do that." While still looking at the TV I said "If you're trying to boost my ego don't bother" She waved her hands and said "No I'm not, just a matter of fact thing"

"Well, it's easy to do, I won't bother explaining the mechanics of it but you'd be surprised how much I still remember... just a matter of fact thing"

"Is that so?"

"Yeah..."

"... hmph."

We polished off the pizza and watched TV until 10pm, noticing the news coming on I said "Cmon, you should probably go take a shower now, I'll set up your bed and stuff", she went into her boxes, then turned around and said "I don't have any more pyjamas... or clean towels..."

"Hold on" I said while getting up to walk into my room, then I dumped a fresh pile of jogging bottoms, an old T-shirt and towel next to her, "Thanks." She said as she made her way past me and into the bathroom, I set everything up for her and when she came out I went to bed, not long after I settled I heard movement, then the bathroom light shone into my bedroom through the cracks around the door... then when she was done, I heard a knock on my door.

## 1233055 (OP)

"It's open," I said hazily, my mind firmly in sleep mode from the long days work, she shuffled in and took a seat on the bed, asking if we could talk and saying it wouldn't take long, "Alright" I said with my arms over my eyes "quickly though...", she sat fidgeting for a moment then looking away with her back towards me she began, "I've been thinking all day while filling out that paperwork... and I'm scared about how you might react when I say this..."

"No going back on our deal." I said firmly "and you're definitely not going back there"

"I know..." She said quietly "I'm not trying to go back on the deal, I promise..."

"Alright... then whats this about?"

"... Do you think you'll ever be able to say my name again..?"

I'll admit, it felt like she was pressuring me a little bit and it made me uneasy, but I tried not to get angry about it, I wanted to go to sleep and I've never been good at going to sleep pissed off, so I let out a deep breath and gave the only answer that I could think of, "I'm only going to say this once... how you take it is your problem", I felt her shuffle, probably nervous about what I was going to say.

"You did something so horrible to me and my family that I honestly sat awake at night for weeks wishing I could burst into flames, I lost a lot because of what you did, and what makes me angry the most is that you can't even come up with a good reason for it... That leaves me imagining that you never loved me and that you did it sheerly out of spite and the fact you could... telling you what I went through is pointless because it's in the past, it's over now and I'm through it, it might have taken me back a few years but whats done is done. nothing can change it... now if you were in my position, and I'd done all that to you, do you think you'd be able to say my name without feeling angry?"

... "No."

## 1233172 (OP)

She began to sob, which put me in a spot... I wouldn't be able to get to sleep with her sobbing "Fuck me..." I thought. sitting up, too tired to think about the implications I put my arm around her and pulled her sideways and down onto my chest and shushed her, I was more than aware of how it could be interpreted but I really just wanted to quiet her down so I could get some sleep, eventually her sobbing softened and I'd noticed she'd grabbed my arm to cuddle, a little annoyed at her taking liberties after all that I'd said I decided not to act rashly and set her off again, a little part of me was happy about it, it's exactly how she used to sleep with me, she had to be touching me somehow, whether she'd be wrapping herself around my arm or sleeping on my chest with her fingers touching her mouth, it made me smile briefly, before that feeling was consumed by darker memories, I let out a loud sigh and with a quiet "For fuck sake..." I settled down and eventually fell asleep.

## 1233809 (OP)

Man that pizza was tasty... if any of you have a snappy tomato pizza near you, order one! If it's anything like the one I had you'll be blown away by it's deliciousness, even when cold!

I awoke at around 5:30 and found her sprawled over me, she had been awake in the night, that much was obvious because I noticed the unzipped sleeping bag was there too, maybe she got up to take a piss or maybe she was too cold and went to get it, either way it was curious... what was more curious was the way she had her hand up my shirt, she always had a thing for that... I remembered us having a long conversation about the scar tissue after the first time we had sex, she asked what it was like and I told her scar tissue is almost hyper-sensitive, running your finger over it felt weird, like a tingling sensation... when I landed on the floor after the garage accident it crushed my ribs inwards and fractured them in a few places, one of them broke too and got lodged... I had to have an operation to set them all back in place, thus, the scar, it only took me a couple of months to get over that, and although I was excluded from PE and sports for a while (making me chubby) I eventually completely healed and the only momento of that near brush with my maker was that scar, she always had a thing for touching it... I lay there for a while watching her sleep, and very slowly peeled the blanker over and lifted the back of the spare t-shirt that was immensely baggy on her, it made me angry to look at it... her soft olive skin riddled with deep patches of bruises scattered everywhere, so much so you could hardly see her true skin tone from the angle I was looking from, I pulled the t-shirt down again and gently scratched the top of her head with my fingers through her hair, the sun was beginning to creep and I needed to get up for work,

I am the OP, and I'll be writing again soon, just came back from my run and putting dinner on, the next part is the heart of the cool story, my posts are easy to spot because they're consistent with my writing style, but the pastebin I posted before I went to bed is everything up to where we are so far.

## 1233814 (OP)

when she began to stir I took her arms and placed them near her chest before shifting out from under her and jumping out of bed, I quickly showered expecting her to be up but she was still under than light blue sleeping bag quilting, so I sat down on the edge of the bed, took the hairdryer out of the drawer and turned it on, as I began to blowdry my hair she turned around to face me and with no expression she watched for a moment as I dried my hair., when I turned the dryer off and stood up to open my wardrobe she sat up, I turned around and said "Still not a morning person..." she smiled and rubbed her face with her hands as I fished out a shirt and tie, and noticed she was watching me in the mirror next to my bed, as I looked into it she looked away. "Y'know I'd charge you if I wasn't sure you were broke until next week, what happened to sleeping in the livingroom anyway? My sofas are comfortable aren't they?" she said nothing for a moment, then as I was doing my tie she said "Sorry Dan.." I looked at her in the mirror and said "Well don't make a habit of it or anything, remember the deal... now what are you gonna do today?"

She scratched her head as she pondered, then said "Go to the bank and hand in the change forms, post my passport and drivers license changes, call in to work and make sure I'm on for tomorrow..." "-- and take the laundry to the laundromat down the road?", she stared at me for a moment before nodding, then made her way to the bathroom.

## 1241637 (OP)

I felt a pang of guilt using her to get the laundry done but it was only down the road and if she was going to be living with me for the time being she should help out with chores, I wash my clothes once a week anyway so she wouldn't have too much to carry and it's better than me taking her stuff, ex girlfriend or not women have a thing with clothes and they don't like other people touching them...

Confident that she had a game plan for the day I set off for work, and as usual the working day way pretty damned uneventful, "At least it's friday" I thought while I was standing in the briefing room, the day went fast as I ploughed through the pile of paperwork on my desk in a serious attempt to get the drop on next week, by the time 4:30 hit every document had been seen to and seeing as I'd skipped lunch I told my boss I was getting off early, content with the fact that I'd cleared my workload he waved me out and I made my way down to the carpark, in my car I pulled out my phone and went to call her but I realized that I'd deleted her number... "Can't hurt" I thought to myself as I keyed in the number I knew 7 years ago, "I haven't changed my number so it's possible she hasn't changed hers...", I set the phone to go through the car speakers and placed it in the dock as I drove out onto the main road, it took her a while but she picked up "H-hello?"

"Oh so you still use this number? Thats good."

"oh hello Daniel"

"Hi, so did you get everything done today?"

"Yeah, I'm at the laundromat now"

"Good, so it's friday and I usually have pizza on fridays... So I'm getting pizza, will you be back in about an hour or two?"

"Yes. But you don't have to buy me anything"

## 1241641 (OP)

"I'm not eating pizza in front of you, thats fucked, and if you feel bad about it then we can go halves, sound good?"

"... Okay."

"Cool, see you soon."

"Bye."

So I stopped off at Snappy Tomato Pizza and got a pizza with her toppings on one half and mine on the other, then went into the offlicense and got a 4 pack of coors in a vain attempt to make her stop drinking my beer, threw the bag and the box in the back seat of the car and set off towards home with some cheesy rock rap, thinking about it I'm sure it was Xcutioners.

## 1241656 (OP)

My door was wide open when I got back to the flat... my mind started spinning as I walked through the hallway, all the doors wide open, light fitting smashed... my framed signed album art poster in the hallway on the floor glass smashed and the frame trampled, peering into the bathroom the mirror was cracked with shards over and inside the sink basin, the shower curtain pulled down and the hot water left running in the sink... the livingroom was completely trashed, the sofas toppled over, the glass on my coffee table shattered all over the floor and I could see bits of her phone amongst it, as if it had been picked up and bombed down towards the floor causing it to shatter on impact, light fitting hanging down like someone had tried to rip it down, bulbs smashed, her moving boxes were also kicked over and her things were scattered around the room... TV shattered and my hifi system completely obliterated, bits of wood, plastic and glass everywhere, and in the kitchen my stove top was cracked and the appliances smashed all over the floor... I walked into my bedroom, threw the pizza on the bed, rubbed my face then took my cigarettes out of my pocket and popped one out into my mouth, dipping my head slightly to catch the lighters flame...

## 1241662 (OP)

looking around the room, footprints on my bed, the wardrobe doors had been booted inwards and my desk lamp had been thrown against the wall, I leaned over into my bedside cabinet and as I thought, my emergency bank notes had been taken out of my jewellery box along with my dads 1953 Seiko watch he got in Osaka years before I was born, my mothers locket I was planning to get fixed and give to my sister for her 18th, various bits of jewelery I'd accumulated over the years and my familys signet ring I was given for my 21st... I felt nothing... I was so taken back I couldn't even bring myself to feel angry, the ash on my cigarette dropped on the floor as I sat thinking... "Where is she... I said if he went near her again I'll bury him, I can't think of anyone else..."

## 1242027 (OP)

I rubbed my hands with my face again, trying to stop the surge of rage I could feel welling up inside my stomach... this wasn't the time or place, I took the cigarette from my mouth and took a long, deep breath, then rose to my feet and threw the cigarette butt into the toilet and flushed it, then I went into my cupboard, taking out a dark blue and black nike bag, then went into my kitchen first, into the cupboard beneath the sink and took a bottle of window cleaner, 2 microfibre rags and a paint mask, then back into my bedroom and took out a beanie hat, a black track suit top and bottoms and my black gym trainers... and finally the bathroom cabinet, I popped open my first aid box and took out a pair of purple medical sanitized gloves still in the packet and finally phoned the police and told them my place had been ransacked... the officer didnt take 10 minutes to arrive, he bought with him a SOCO bloke who went around looking for prints (but didnt find any, surprise surprise), after giving him a statement and a list of things that were taken they left, shortly after the drove away I started rummaging through her things... as I thought the stupid bastard didn't make sure he took her keys with him, and with those in my pocket I, without giving it any thought other than imagining what I'd do when I got there, jumped into my car and made my way back to that shit hole...

## 1242036 (OP)

I made sure to pull up a street away, I jumped into the back of the car and put the track suit top on, followed by the bottoms, then the beanie, then the shades, leaving my cargos and work shirt in the car, making sure my t-shirt was tucked in before zipping up the tracksuit top I changed my shoes for tennis trainers, and almost as if I was on auto-pilot I simply took the bag and exited the car from the back seat, putting her keys in one pocket and my keys in the other, I walked straight into the flat entrance and slowly walked up the stairs, "3b" I told myself, taking out my gloves and slipping them on, followed by the disposable paint mask, as I stood next to the door I listened intently... "TV's on... lights are on... kneeling down against the letter box and lifting the flap slowly to hear what was going on inside more clearly I could hear whimpering, her whimpering... then a THUMP followed by "SHUT YOUR FACE!" which made her shriek, I pictured her cowering in the corner like those domestic abuse adverts on TV, making up my mind I took her keys out of mypocket slowly and carefully I pushed the yale key into the top barrel lock, turning it quietly until the door unlocked, then without making a sound I took the key out and folded them into my hands and put them back into my pocket, zipping them up,

"3...2...1."

## 1242044 (OP)

And letting all the pent up anger out in one flash I kicked the door and ran in letting the door catch on the spring and slam behind me, running straight into the livingroom and giving him no time at all to react, I rushed straight for him sitting on the sofa and before he could even say "FUCKI-" I ran in with my arm cocked and punched him straight in the face with all of my strength, not stopping I grabbed him by his collar and pulled him off the sofa and onto the floor, unleashing a barrage of kicks to his body, gritting my teeth and growling like a wild beast with every blow, "FUCKIN PRICK WHAT THE FUCK DID I TELL YOU WOULD HAPPEN" I growled as I lay into him, he folded his arms over his face and curled up into a ball, as much as I wanted to I couldn't stop kicking him, my impluses completely took control and in all the rage I lost my inhibitions, kicking at his arms until they gave way and then jumping down on him and laying into his face before raising my fist up twatting him on his nose again which was already freshly bruised from the night before, I continued while the blood from his nose pooled in his throat causing him to gag and cough it up all over the side of his face and up on to mine, the purple surgical gloves I was wearing were stained, and I'm sure if could see it, it would have been on my tracksuit too... at this point he wasn't trying to cry out anymore, he was just taking it, and if she hadn't grabbed my arm to stop me I'd have probably kept going until I killed him,

## 1242050 (OP)

As she grabbed my fist I looked up at her and growled at her through the mask and she shrieked and fell over, I kept my eyes locked on her, she had a black eye and her cheek had swollen up badly, enraged by it I turned around and punched him in the mouth causing her to cry out and wimper loudly, looking back at her again and seeing her sitting on the floor, wide-eyed and trembling at me, then looking at that sad sack of shit on the floor barely moving, I grabbed him by the collar and screamed "WATCH! MONEY! LOCKET! RING! NOW!", he pointed over to his jacket and I picked it up, then stuffed it into my bag, I looked back at her sitting on the floor watching me... I took out the window cleaner and sprayed them on the clean side of the rag, then used it to wipe over the door knob, the back of the door and anything else I could remember touching last time I was there, then I took the nozzle off of the bottle and Splashed a drop on his face that was fresh with grazes, he screamed out in pain as the chemicals seeped into his wounds and I screamed at him "WAKE UP! LOOK AT ME!", grabbing his collar and commanding his full attention.

## 1242056 (OP)

"What did I tell you last time I was here mate?" he went to speak and I grabbed his head and slammed it off the floor before picking him up by his collar again, "SHUT UP! DIDN'T I TELL YOU NOT TO GO NEAR HER!? DIDN'T I TELL YOU I'D FUCKING KILL YOU! HUH! OPEN YOUR FUCKING EARS MATE!" "YES!" he cried out "YOU BREAK INTO MY FLAT!? YOU TRASH MY SHIT!? YOU STEAL MY STUFF!? YOU TAKE HER!?" he lay there looking up at me, blood dripping down his face "LETS COUNT THE CHARGES! BREAKING AND ENTERING! THEFT! CRIMINAL DAMAGE! ASSAULT! BATTERY! GBH! KIDNAPPING! DO YOU THINK YOU'RE SOME SORT OF GANGSTER YOU FAT FUCKING CUNT!?" He looked up at me, saying nothing... I dropped his collar and stood up, tipping the window cleaner all over his face and clothes, then stood over him with my lighter in my hand, "P-Please!" he wimpered, covering his face with his arms "GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON!" I yelled, my thumb ready to flick open the lid, he began shuffling backwards until his back was against the sofa, then a soft, whimpering voice from across the room said

"... He's not worth it..."

## 1242084 (OP)

"He isn't worth it Dan..." she said quietly behind me "Don't throw your life away over him... Please..." I turned to her, then turned to him, then flicked up the lighter with my thumb ready to spark the flint, his eyes wobbled and I'm sure he was experiencing one of those "life before your eyes" moments... I sparked the flame and helt it over him, then spoke softly "I don't have much of a life to begin with mate, if I dropped this on you now all it would mean to me is free meals and a nice soft bed for 6-10 years... I hear they even give you TV's and Playstations in your cells now too for good behavior... 6-10 years of no bills, no stress, and a very long time to laugh about how I barbacued a fat fucking pig, thats if they could catch me anyway... I don't know if you've noticed but the gear I'm wearing is a fairly safe forensic precaution..."

"I'll never go near you again!" He said, pleaded "I promise! I won't!"

## 1242386 (OP)

"DO YOU THINK YOUR WORD MEANS ANYTHING!?" I screamed, causing him to jolt and clammer backwards further "I DON'T KNOW KNOW MAN! 10 Years in prison sounds pretty fucking good to me!" I closed the lighter into my fist and used my other hand to grab his collar "I KNOW YOU WONT GO NEAR HER AGAIN, AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT STUPID ENOUGH TO CALL THE POLICE EITHER! NOT WHEN YOUR FAT FUCKING DNA IS ALL OVER MY FLAT! YOU'RE GOING TO STAY AWAY BECAUSE IF I SEE YOU AGAIN, I WONT BURN YOU ALIVE, I'LL FUCKING TORTURE YOU! IF I SO MUCH AS SEE YOU WALKING DOWN THE STREET I'LL BE BACK HERE AND WE CAN DO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN!"

I booted him in the stomach as I stood up, then picked up my bag and collected up the rag and window cleaner before zipping it up and putting it on my back, I walked over to his TV stand and booted the leg causing the TV to topple over and smash on the floor, nothing else in the room looked as if it had any value, I looked towards her and said "If you need anything, nows the time to get it, because if I have to come back here one more time he's leaving in black bags."

## 1242395 (OP)

She shook her head and stood up, "I need you to open the doors for me... I can't..." and held up my hands, "Go down the stairs and wait, I'll be down in a sec okay?" She stared at me "Don't give me that look... I'm done here, I just want to make sure he doesn't get any ideas", she slowly walked backwards then out of the room, then out of the door to the flat, I stood staring at him for a while, then said "Who told you where I lived? Don't try my patience." holding up the lighter. 

"Betty... told me your name... then I looked..." He said, barely able to keep his head up as he sat there slumped down over himself, "... Call her, or anyone who knows her again, and I will be back, got that?" He remained motionless, just staring at me, barely able to keep his head up. "If I ever have to come back here again, I'm going to decapitate you, and thats the least painful thing I can think of... I will burn out your eyes and cut out your tongue, I'll sew it up into your mouth along with your fingers, then I'll pour kerosene down your nose and light you up like a fucking jack-o-lantern you disgusting pig." I turned and walked towards the door, banging the light switch with my arm causing the room to go dark as I made my way out.

## 1242423 (OP)

As I walked down the steps I removed the gloves and folded them into one another inside out,tieing them up at the end, then I threw them into my bag along with with paint mask, as I reached the bottom she was standing very still, neither of us said a word as we approached the car, before getting in I took off my tracksuit jacket and trainers and threw them into the bag, reaching in I took out my money, ring, locket and watch and put them in the centre console, along with 60 quid I found in his wallet, before stuffing the coat back in followed by my t-shirt, beanie and bottoms, then I put my work shirt back on followed by my cargos and shoes... then I stepped out of the back and into the drivers seat.

Still she refused to say a word, when I started the car she said "Please take those off..." "What?" I said, looking towards her while taking out a cigarette, "Those fucking sunglasses..." She said as she broke down crying, I took them off to examine them and there were blotches of blood, I looked in the mirror and there was blood on my cheeks too, I was also drenched in sweat, I could feel the cold wind through my car window as the adrenaline slowly dissipated through my body and my hear rate came down... her crying was loud and mournful, I touched her and she flinched at me with fear in her eyes...

## 1242447 (OP)

I turned around in the road and pulled away, driving the long way back through the middle of the city, "She probably thinks I'm a monster..." I thought, my cheek resting against the palm of my hand as I drove lazily down the pretty vacant residential streets towards the commercial and central business districts... I peered over at her and she was staring out of the window, not moving an inch as if her body was in suspended animation, even as the car swayed as I took corners she was as stiff as a plank and as silent as a mouse... eventually I reached my destination and pulled up along side a canal, she turned to me as I stepped out of the car and into the back, and making sure nobody was around to see, I threw the bag as hard as I could sending it flying into the night sky and with a "Plunk" the evidence would never be recovered, the filthy water and the enzymes within would wash and eat away at anything incriminating long before anyone would find it, it's a pretty fucking deep canal after all, and jumping back into the car and one wet wipe later there was no trace of what I'd done that night.

Only what existed in the minds of the parties involved. and possibly the CCTV cameras I didn't check for... not that I'm worried he'll call mind, his rap sheet made me look like a choir boy in comparison, even if it was only on paper.

## 1242758 (OP)

As we continued home she started sniffling, I imagined that she was going through a mental replay of the last 4-5 hours... and honestly I felt bad about what she'd been through, but worse for seeing me that way... Anyone who knows me knows I'm not quick to violence, despite my sweet and sour working-class upbringing that was the very first time I hadn't been able to put a cap on my anger... or more accurately to say that usually, like I imagine most people to have, there's a valve you turn on your dark side, letting out just enough, always being in control of your actions and keeping that inner demon under lock and key, tonight, more than anything else it scared me that I was even able to completely loose control of that valve, able to give yourself over to that demon and act completely on impulse without inhibition or restraint, I'm positive, absolutely sure that had she not been there to stop me I'd have killed him, I probably could have kept wildly slamming my fists into that persons face until he passed out and suffocated on his own blood and even then, I probably wouldn't have stopped until every last ounce of evil, pent up aggression and rage was spent and he was long dead... It was a chilling knowing that there was a limit, and that I'd reached it.

## 1242902 (OP)

We got out of the car and slowly made our way up to home sweet home, we both stopped at the door threshold and looked in as I turned the lights on, I turned to her and said "It's alright if you want to sleep, we can change the sheets on my bed first and you can get to bed while-"

"No, it's ok... I'll help"

With the police report on my desk and the pictures on my phone from when the officers walked around with me, it was alright for the place to be cleaned up... The officer told me as long as I was able to produce the pictures, save most of the wreckage and give the insurers the document he had filled out for me I should be able to recieve the payout no problem, I went into the cupboard and got out the dustpan and brush, the vaccum and some boxes to put the shards into, we set about cleaning up the livingroom first, neither of us was very energetic about it.

When the floor was cleared I tipped the sofas back up and pushed them into the middle of the room minus the demolished coffee table that had been pushed to the back, the timer lamp was about the only thing he spared in my livingroom as it's a dim wall-plug type, I used to use it whenever I was stopping out late to give wannabe criminals the impression someone was home and turn itself off around 3am when I was usually home and passed out on my bed, even so it created an almost calm atmosphere in the otherwise fucked up livingroom, I disconnected the TV and place it at the back of the room along with every other smashed object and the boxes of wreckage "Well thats one room down" I told myself, I looked to her and she still had the same low expression as before, neither denying nor confirming what was going on. "Hey, this was the worst of it, lets take a break..." I said as I sat down picking up the ashtray off the floor and putting it on the arm of the chair.

### 1242962

I swear if you tell her to shower again I'm gonna go insane

(yes im the guy who complained last night about your multiple showers)

### 1243024 (NOT OP)

>>1242902
She suddenly started breaking down, "I-I can't stand this Dan... Knowing what you did, I just seem so dirty". I was shocked by this and all I could say is "You really need a shower, to think about it, I've only showered 4 times today." I told her to go and fetch some towels from the drawer upstairs. I started work on the next room, despite me being sweaty from my lack of showers. After all the commotion from today, all I could think about is my perfect shower. I couldn't bare it.. I dropped my brush and walked up to the stairs into the bathroom.

I was stunned by what I saw my shower was... Broken. I fell to my knees and shouted at the top of my lungs "NOOOOO"-

### 1243031

>>1243024  
Fucking lol'd my ass off.  
I need to start checking the trip[code]...

## 1243024 (OP)

She sat down next to me, and hesitated before leaning on me. "This is all going to costs thousands to replace..." she said, clutching her hands together, a tear slowly rolled down her cheek before she mumbled "I'm so sorry..." and bought her head down to meet her hands, I rubbed her back gently with my hand and shushed her and she turned into me and put her head into my chest.

"Nah, just a 300 quid excess fee, not bad all things considered, a couple of years back I found that More Than Home Insurance advert entertaining enough to look into online, I guess TV ads really do work on stupid people..." I could have sworn I heard her giggle, and that bought me a little comfort, she stayed like that for a while as I rubbed her back... eventually the sounds of her crying and sniffling dampened and I had a moment to think, "Listen... People live out their whole lives and never see someone loose it the way I did... I don't want you to think that I am that kind of person...", there was a brief silence and still with her head on my chest, she quietly said "You're the same person you was 7 years ago Daniel... the gentle giant type... remember when in school that bunch of year 9's was picking on that year 7 lad and you marched over to them? That was when I very first noticed you in school... you stuck out because of your height, but... you stuck out to me because you were kind... that part of you is never going to change..."

"... mmm. you're probably right, but you don't see my doing charity work or helping old ladies across the street, I drink and smoke like a sailor too..."
She looked up at me and stared into my eyes for a moment, before putting her head back down and saying "... doesn't matter... you are who you are."

## 1243285 (OP)

I lost myself in thought about what she said, and before I knew it she was sound asleep on my lap... I gently got myself out from under her and went into my bedroom for something to throw over her, the only thing I could find was this big brown winter warmer thing, the sleeping bag had been trampled on so I folded it up and put it by the side of my bed, then started changing the bed sheets, pillow cases and duvet covers, I had to smile, the only spare set I have are these bright orange and green retro looking ones my 70s Show loving sister bought me one christmas, it made my bed look like a giant tic-tac, quietly I brushed up the glass from the hallway and tipped it into a bag along with the smashed lightbulbs and bathroom mirror, the bigger shards stuck out of the bottom as I picked it up and a few little shards fell out as I quietly walked into the livingroom and I flicked them into the box as I made my way out to sort out the bathroom, not a lot had been done besides tearing down the already redundant shower curtain, the mirror shards had been taken out of the sink too so I just decided it needed a wipe down, in the kitchen everything was fucked, even the microwave which made me angry seeing as I had a stone cold giant pizza in the desk in my bedroom and no way to cook it, not even the kettle worked so I couldn't make a cup of tea, but luckily the demented cunt had left my fridge alone save for a few dents in the door.

## 1243451 (OP)

Taking out 2 beers I walked into the livingroom, in there I amped up the heating a little in a vein attempt to maybe warm up the pizza too... or maybe to make the beer taste better, like how it does ice cold on a hot summers day, I gently rubbed her arm as I sat down and opened up my laptop, luckily my modem and router were tucked away behind the TV so everything was working, as she woke up I pushed the pizza box toward her along with her beer and said "It's kinda cold and I know you're not hungry but if you dont eat you wont be able to sleep well, just a few slices and you'll be alright..." she nodded and took a slice out and began munching on it, beer in hand and I loaded up an episode of Sherlock on BBCiPlayer, we sat quietly while we ate, drank and watched the massive plothole what was the latest episode, by half way through I noticed I had plowed through my half of the pizza and had already started on hers, she didn't seem to care at all even though we'd planned on going halves on it, I'd have asked for the money but I was pretty sure she was feeling bad enough about how much she owed me, directly or indirectly for that question to be in any way tactful, by the end of the episode I had a cigarette in my hand and half a beer left, with the adrenaline completely out of my system and a full stomach I was pretty tired so I pushed the laptop onto the middle seat on top of the empty pizza box and stood up, "I'm going to go take a \<spoiler\>shower\</spoiler\>" I said looked down at her "you alright for clothes after I'm out?"

## 1243716 (OP)

She nodded silently while loading up something on the laptop, "I'll be ok, my PJs are clean" she said hazily, content with that I collected up a towel and a set of boxers and went in, when I came out she went in straight after almost mechanically, I went into my bedroom to blowdry my hair and when she came out she sat and did the same, I pushed the sofas together in the livingroom and left my laptop on with an internet radio station on quietly, then I turned off the screen so it wouldn't hamper her efforts to get some sleep, I threw some pillows onto the sofas and turned the timer lamp on, knowing it was all set for her I turned off the lights and went back into my room where she was just finishing up with the blowdryer, "you're all set in there" I said rubbing my face and picking up my cigarettes from the bed side table, I took my phone out of my cargos pocket and put it on charge, then put the radio on quiet on that too in a small attempt to block out my thoughts when I went to bed, then I went out on to the balcony and regretted not putting on some shorts and a t-shirt as the cold winds whistled around me, I thought about all the crazy shit I'd done that day and smiled to myself, shaking my head as I blew out smoke, it was pointless to think about, "Whats done is done" I said to myself out loud and I leaned down and rested my head on my arms, letting out a huge yawn and flicking the cigarette butt onto the concrete below and heading back inside.

## 1244045 (OP)

Sorry guys, sister called and I poured myself a rum and coke, couldn't exactly tell her to get off the phone.

Before we move on and for the sake of Trivia

- I'm 26, this stuff happened last week
- `> "A week last Tuesday"`
- I usually shower 2-3 times a day, 3 if I've been working out or it's been really hot while I've been at work, I don't like the feeling of being sweaty and sticky
- I missed out a part in the past post about her saying I still had blood on my face, I couldn't see it because the mirror was smashed in the bathroom.

I'll post the next part in the next thread.
