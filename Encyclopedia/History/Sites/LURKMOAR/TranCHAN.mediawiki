'''TranCHAN''' is the child of [[CHANCHAN]], spawned for [[cross-dressers]], [[traps]] and [[trans]] people. It began as some boards for specific [[camwhores]], such as [[Half-chan]] and [[Tarp-chan]]. About a year after [[Male General]] was born, there was sufficient evidence that cross dressers and trans people also didn't have a place to post, and so TranCHAN was created on 2009/06/08.
