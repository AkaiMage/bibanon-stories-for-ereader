The character V from the movie "V For Vendetta" became a fast growing [[meme]] shortly after the movie was released in the U.S.  Usually involves "REMEMBER REMEMBER THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER," other lines from the movie, pictures of V in the movie, and/or a picture of V's mask, sometimes on other [[meme]]s.

On March 24th, 2006, the V meme peaked when a user parodied a speech by V containing almost nothing but words starting with the letter B. "BAM TO BEHOLD, A PUBLIC BULLETIN BOARD, BUILT OF BOTH BRILLIANCE AND BARBARITY BY BASTARDS WITH BONERS. THIS BASTION, NO MERE BULWARK OF BOREDOM, IS A BRUTAL BARRAGE OF BLISTERING BULLSHIT, BARELY BENEVOLENT... BUT BEHIND THE BIGOTRY AND BOOBS, BEYOND THE BITTER BROADCASTS OF BRAGGING BUFFOONS: HERE BE THE BODY POLITIC. A BROTHERHOOD OF BLASPHEMY, BLESSED WITH MORE BALLS THAN BRAINS, BATTLING THE BLAND, THE BOGUS, THE BENIGN. BEDLAM? BRING IT ON. BUT I BABBLE... BETTER TO BE BRIEF. YOU MAY CALL ME [[/b/]]."

The thread was stickied, and reached over a thousand posts.

A variant of the "[[/m/#Is this Mecca?|Is this Mecca?]]" meme, using a picture of V's face, has also appeared in [[/v/]].
