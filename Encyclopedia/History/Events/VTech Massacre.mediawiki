On 2007/04/16, a lone gunman decked himself out in body armor and 2 pistols and proceeded to shoot up the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (better known as Virginia Tech, or VTech) before [[An Hero#Become An Hero|becoming an hero]]. He was a South Korean immigrant. This school shooting was the absolute bloodiest in American history, and [[/b/]] was quick to capitalize on this tragedy.

[[Rule 34]] of the shooter appeared within hours of the shooting, and [[photoshops]] of Counterstrike gun sights and weapons imposed on images of VTech buildings soon popped up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=24776982&x=v-tech |title=4chan Thread Containing Photoshops |publisher=4chanarchive}}</ref> /b/ produced multiple parodies of the massacre, which ranged from a fake ad asking how many people were killed in the shooting (answer correctly to win a PS3!), to vandalizing Wikpedia articles relating to the shooting, to creating the infamous www.vtechdies.com site. It also resulted in a brief revival of the old [[VTEC JUST KICKED IN YO]] meme, in the form of "VTECH JUST KICKED IN YO".

However, [[/b/]] has grudgingly acknowledged the heroism of some of the shooter's victims, most notably Liviu Librescu, a Jewish Holocaust survivor who single-handedly held off the gunman long enough for his students to escape through a window, at the cost of his own life. Even the [[/b/tards]] acknowledged his heroism as 'epic' and he was dubbed the greatest bad-ass since King Leonidas, which is exorbitantly high praise coming from /b/, considering its love for ''300''.

A fake screenshot was also made (with the time altered to appear that it had been posted on April 15) of a post saying "hey /b/ I'm going to kill people at vtech today in the name of [[anonymous]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=24895482&x=more+4chan+vtech+news |title=Swedish Newspaper Publishing False Information |publisher=4chanarchive}}</ref> Despite the fact that posts on /b/ purge far too quickly for such a post to have still been discovered after the massacre (as the hoaxer claimed to have done), it was reported in some media outlets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=24869275&x=4chan+in+swedish+vtech+news |title=Sweden's Biggest News Site Publishing False Information |publisher=4chanarchive}}</ref> There is in fact no evidence the moron was a /b/tard, or even that he had ever been to [[4chan]].
