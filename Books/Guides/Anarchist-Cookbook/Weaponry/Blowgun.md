In this article I shall attempt to explain the use and manufacture
of a powerfull blow-gun and making darts for the gun.The possesion of
the blow gun described in this article IS a felony.
So be carefull where you use it. I don't want to get you all busted.

## Needed

1. Several strands of yarn (About 2 inches a-piece)
2. A regular pencil
3. A 2 1/4 inch long needle (hopefully with a beaded head. If not
   obtainable,wrap tape around end of needle.
4. 2-3 1/4 foot pipe. (PVC or Aluminum) Half a inch in diameter

## Constructing the dart

1. Carefully twist and pull the metal part (Along with eraser)
of the pencil till it comes off.
2. Take Pin and start putting about 5-7 Strands of yarn on the pin. Then
push them up to the top of the pin. But not over the head of the pin (orthe tape).
3. Push pin through the hollow part of the head where the pencil was before.
4. That should for a nice looking dart. (see illustration)

                        -  is the pin it-self
                        /  is the head of the pin

## Using the Darts:
  
1. Now take the finished dart and insert it in the tube
(if it is too small put on more yarn.)
2. Aim the tube at a door, wall, sister, ect.
3. blow on the end of the pipe.
4. Sometimes the end of the pipe may be sharp. When this happens I
suggest you wrap it with some black electrician tape.It should feel
a lot better.

## Second Tutorial

-A regular sized straw, that doesn't bend
-Some of those pin/needles with the small colored balls on the end
-A spool of thread

You simply tie three of four 1/2 inch or so, strands of thread around the end of the pin, so that the colored ball keeps it from sliding off. Then you just insert your improvised darts into the end of the straw and blow. Very simple concept, and lots of fun in the classroom
