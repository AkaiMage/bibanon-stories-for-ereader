'''Rei-chan''' is '''Rei Ayanami''' from ''Neon Genesis Evangelion''. The girls of ''Evangelion'' have numerous fans and critics.

Pictures of Rei were banned for a month after [[4chan]]ners, frustrated with all the pictures of her being flooded, started to counterflood with pictures of Rei's hair on various people and objects with the now famous "BLUE HAIR = REI", "ZOMG REI" or "IT'S REI FAP FAP FAP". Eventually the flooding stopped, but the quotes and their mutations pop up from time to time.

=== Reidick ===
Sometime in 2004, '''Reidick''', a scan of a penis with blue "hair" and the caption "'''TEH REI'''" drawn in [[MS Paint]], was created and endlessly spamposted to [[/b/]] by '''Rei-Chan''', with the message "'''She is cute, that is why she is called Rei Chan.'''" This message has become a [[meme]] in itself.

=== Teh Rei ===
Reidick was also floodposted to [[/f/]] in a [[Flash]] movie, called '''Teh Rei.swf''' (see below), with the chant "'''Internet FUCK'''" in the background, which predictably got [[saged]] mercilessly as fast as it was reposted. Reidick has appeared in more legitimate Flash movies, notably "Sage Man" by Okk, and the [[/b/]] version makes a surprise appearance in Disaster Labs' "8-Bitch Fyve: Evil on the Attack".
