## Recipe 1

_(Originally By Bill)_

For a relatively low shrapnel explosion, I suggest pouring it into an empty
35mm film cannister.  Poke a hole in the plastic lid for a fuse.  These
goodies make an explosion audible a mile away easily.

1. Poke the hole before putting the flash powder into the cannister.
2. Don't get any powder on the lip of the cannister.
3. Only use a very small quantity and work your way up to the desired
   result.
4. Do not pack the powder, it works best loose.
5. Do not grind or rub the mixture - it is friction sensitive.
6. Use a long fuse.

## Recipe 2

-fill Kodak film case (y'know, the black cylinder with the grey cap) 
with explosive of your choice.  Drill hole in grey lid, insert fuse, 
and tape it back together very tightly.  Light.

## Recipe 3

-poke a hole it the grey cap facing outwards, and insert an M-80 
with fuse going through the hole and reseal, taping it tightly ALL 
AROUND the case.  Place in plastic mailbox, light, close door, and 
get the hell away!  Because of the tight airspace, the destructive 
power of the explosion is increased 5X.  Works under water too, with 
a drop of wax, or preferably rubber cement around where the cap and 
wick meet.
