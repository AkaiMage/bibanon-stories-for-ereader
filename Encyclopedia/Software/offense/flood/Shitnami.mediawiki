'''Shitnami''' is a tool written specifically to fuck with Faggottalk and Kimmo's sanity. It exploits a pretty lulzy hole in Faggottalk's deep search function to bypass the search flood detection. Meaning we can send as many deep search requests as we want, as fast as we want. Sad MySQL is sad. 

Threading and proxies supported. Requires .NET framework (v3.5, or possibly v2.0 though I haven't tested that myself). Should run on Linux if you know what you're doing (WINE is your friend).

STILL IN DEVELOPMENT so don't yell at me if there's bugs.
