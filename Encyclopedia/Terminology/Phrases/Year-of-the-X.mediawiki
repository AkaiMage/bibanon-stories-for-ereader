== 2004 - Year of the Yuri ==
== 2005 - Year of the Loli ==
== 2006 - Year of the Trap ==
[[/a/]]'s unofficial title for the year 2006, based on the abnormally high number of anime/manga featuring crossdressing released that year. Among the anime/manga with at least one crossdressing character to air in 2006: ''Princess Princess'', ''Ouran High School Host Club'', ''Black Lagoon'', ''Gankutsuou'', ''Happiness!'', ''Otome Wa Boku Ni Koishiteru'', ''Kashimashi~Girl Meets Girl'', ''Negima'' and ''Rozen Maiden Traumend''. This was also the year that featured the release of the yaoi hentai OVA ''Boku no Pico'', which starred a crossdressing boy as one of the protagonists, and the yuri anime ''Simoun'', in which everyone was born a girl and could decide to become a man upon reaching adulthood. While the vast majority of the shows in question had boys crossdressing as girls, ''Ouran'', ''Rozen Maiden'' and ''Kashimashi'' featured girls crossdressing as boys (although in the case of ''Kashimashi'' the girl in question was a boy turned into a girl by aliens). All in all, it was a weird year to be a heterosexual on [[/a/]].
