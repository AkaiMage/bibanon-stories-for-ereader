The rarest way of identifying oneself on [[4chan]], '''emailfags''' are users who put their addresses in the email field rather than the typical [[sage]] or [[noko]]. The obvious disincentive to doing this is that emails are very easily spammed; thus, only dumb-as-fuck posters or those who use fake addresses become emailfags. Ironically, emailfags are more common on worksafe boards than [[/b/]], the [[board]] that, at times, was [[Forced Anonymous]]. It was the most likely to spawn emailfags since the email field was basically the only way people could differentiate one another on /b/. It is believed [[/b/]]'s natural [[Hive Mind]] and massive size is what suppresses the presence of emailfags.

Unlike Namefags, emailfags are generally better regarded because their posts are semi-Anonymous; most posters never realize they're talking to an emailfag unless they're butthurt enough to double check what at first looks like a sage. Once discovered, though, emailfags are berated just like any other Namefag, with the added danger of their emails getting compromised.
