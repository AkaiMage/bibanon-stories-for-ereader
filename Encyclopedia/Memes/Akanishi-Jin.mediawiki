Pop artist and reverse trap from a Japanese group called 'KAT-TUN'. Pictures of Jin are usually posted by fans of said group and posts usually consist of text saying 'this is jin ____'. The first Jin thread was made on September 4th and lasted a good four hours before it was saged. Other resident [[/b/]]tards believe it is a forced meme, while fans of the reverse trap state that those who dislike him are underage virgins. Jin is frequently associated with the word 'fag' (as he is posted occasionally with his partner Kame) and is seen in a macro with the words 'WATCH OUT STEVE IRWIN, THERES STINGRAYS IN THE OCEAN'.
