[[Image:Retarded.jpg|thumb|Images? In ''my'' wiki?]]
'''Centipedes, in my vagina?''' is originally derived from a pop-up advertisement of a woman looking shocked, which proclaimed '''"Viruses? On my PC?" It's more likely than you think!''' It was quickly edited to refer to a variety of different [[memes]] (eg. "[[Furries]]? On my [[4chan]]?"), and is replied to with "It's more likely than you think!"
