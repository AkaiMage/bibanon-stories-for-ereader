Black Widow is a website crawler which lets you scan a site's structure (like a directory) and then download folders at a time if you choose. This is useful for finding [Bandwidth Raep](/Bandwidth_Raep) images, as the scanner will list file sizes, allowing you to pick the fattest pix. This also allow you to have an overview of files which aren't obviously linked to, useful for sites with shitty layouts.
