A [[meme]] on [[/b/]], born from a screencap of Jessie from Pokemon with a hillariously exaggerated appearence of shock. This screencap's popularity eventually climaxed in a legendary post involving Jessie, James and Meowth reciting their Team Rocket motto shortly before being blasted into the sky by Ash and Pikachu (who celebrate their victory by subsequently engaging in a tongue grapple). The emoticon "8U" was created on the basis of the original screencap.

This was the image that initially created "8U". The original poster of the thread asked anonymous to find the Jesus on this peice of toast, but all who tried claimed that they could only see "8U". Apparently, anonymous is blind.
