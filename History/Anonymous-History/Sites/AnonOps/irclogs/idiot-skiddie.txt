#        DOX OF ECHNONODE ADMIN, "r000t" A SKIDDIE THAT "HACKED" ANONOPS        #
#################################################################################
 
Greetings Pirates, and welcome to another exciting #fuckAnonHaters release.
 
To those who think can hurt Anonymous by hacking us?  Fuck off, we have proof that
you are a bunch of wannabe "whitehats" who sell yourselves out to Law Enforcement.
One of them aka "r000t" or better known as "rootworx" is better described as:
 
     I am r000t. I’m the guy that breaks into email accounts when I’m bored.
     I’m the guy that put CAPTCHA on 4chan (Yeah really, I have proof).
 
Oh wait?  Your the guy who breaks email accounts?  Maybe you should start using
protection when you decide to spread the AnonOps torrent containing the AnonOps
"hack" that carlos1337 performed on November 2011.  
 
The details of the torrent: "Hack the Planet 2 - AnonOps Dead 5.torrent" has only
one specific seeder:
 
        IP address: 69.246.240.125
        Host name: c-69-246-240-125.hsd1.il.comcast.net
        Bit Torrent Agent: uTorrent 3.0
 
Oh wait? You were the furry who DDoSed 4chan?  And you admitted it on your website:
 
        When I flooded 4chan, any thread that wasn’t my spam was a post with my dox.
        It had everything, my name, my address, my phone number, my YouTube, Facebook,
        MySpace, and Steam profiles, my FCC call letters, and so much more.

Oh maybe the previous 4chan'ers didn't include any updated information, so we figured
to do the addtional research about Mr. Blair Strater:

So you think "owning" AnonOps is the least of your problems rite?  Maybe you should
worry about your defacement of your own school's website or that little bomb threat:
       
        See: http://tf2chan.net/inception/res/442.html
        Okay, so some of you might have known that a while back, some airwolf was
        spamming red scout on TF2chan because he was buttmad about scout rule34.
        Well, I have confirmed that he was seized by the Oswego Police Department,
        and is currently facing trial. Approximately a week and a half ago, he defaced
        his school's website with red scout (Big red flag to everyone who knows him.)
        While doing this, he was connected to his IRC network, and was discussing it
        with his internet butt buddies. Now, at this point the Oswego Police Department
        heard that this kid (Blair Strater, aka r000t) was a suspect. After getting a
        warrant for searching, his comptuers and other devices were seized by. After
        they found his IRC logs un-deleted on his computer, they had a warrant for
        his arrest, and he is currently facing trial.
 
Sorry but your not an Anon.  Your just an Anon-hater.  Maybe you should have listened
to your mommy for messing about with Anonymous, the "Internet bad boys gone good".  
Don't worry, your real butt hurt will start when you go to the "big house".
