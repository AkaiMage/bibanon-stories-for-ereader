## Timeline

Quick and dirty timeline, imported every day from Google Docs.

-   2014-08-24 - A thread on /v/ made by an anon is stickied and closed,
    where a mod claim “Your threads aren't being deleted because of the
    content. Your threads are being deleted because they are being
    spammed. Check the catalog before making a new thread about this
    topic.”  /v/259588169 is the sticky. Mods just doing what they’re
    supposed to. Maybe.

-   2014-08-24 - TFYC’s Indiegogo account hacked and made to look like
    it was closed. The culprit is unknown, but their current name is
    allegedly /V/ (sic).

-   Screenshot before it was shut down:

-   /v/259588735 It is unknown what will become of the funds. TFYC
    doesn’t get any Indiegogo money until the campaign is fully funded;
    which might not be so bad, considering that all their accounts are
    compromised.
-   TFYC is supposedly contacting support, but it’s Sunday in the USA,
    so it can take a while. Great timing for the fucking hackers.
-   TFYC’s Twitter is also compromised soon after. /v/ also begins
    having doubts about TFYC after they allegedly announced that [Vivian
    James
    t-shirt](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fi0.kym-cdn.com%2Fphotos%2Fimages%2Foriginal%2F000%2F817%2F256%2Fb98.jpg&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHZkvAkc1oN8PZcAU5jyobEj7UZLw) would
    go towards iFred, a charity that Zoe Quinn had supported.

-   2014-08-23 - With no new shitstorms on Twitter and with a new
    daughter to play with, /v/ spends the day circlejerking about
    Vivian. Discussions are also had.
-   2014-08-22 - As /v/ had raised enough money to design their own
    character, they start designing their musume (daughter for you baka
    gajins). The result is Vivian James. Personality and fanart soon
    follow.

-   Phil Fish and Polytron are supposedly hacked by “the head mod of
    /V/”. Phil Fish announces that he is selling his Fez and Polytron
    IP. The Internet Aristocrat releases the second part of his report.

-   2014-08-21 - “Operation Chemo” begins on /pol/ and spreads to /v/,
    with the goal to help The Fine Young Capitalists (TFYC) bring their
    game jam back to life, after it was killed with help from Zoe.
    JonTron’s livestream is announced and occurs without too much going
    on.
-   2014-08-20 - JonTron appears and starts doing battle. At one point
    furries arrive and help him out. TotalBiscuit helps him out as well.
    Jontron later disappears in fear of backlash.
-   2014-08-19 - Official beginning of the battle. “The Day We Went to
    War”

-   Totalbiscuit reacts to The Internet Aristocrat’s video, drawing in
    Reddit
-   Reddit, tumblr, and even 4chan have civil war when mods delete
    discussion of Zoe Quinn.
-   Fake doxx by Quinn to frame 4chan
-   Rule 34 of Five Guys Burgers and Fries appears
-   Sides are taken, lines are drawn.

-   2014-08-18 - InternetAristocrat makes a video about the Five Guys,
    later releases a “sequel”, the In-N-Out video.
-   2014-08-17 - A year and a half later, Zoe’s ex-boyfriend, Eron,
    makes “The Zoe Post” speaking out against her. Mundane Matt makes a
    video about the issue, which is later removed in a false DMCA claim
    by Zoe Quinn herself. Ouren reveals on Twitter that he was sexually
    harassed by Quinn, and is silenced by Phil Fish.
-   2013-02-14 - Depression Quest, developed by The Quinnspiracy, is
    released. Praise from several vidya news outlets follow. Critics of
    the game are labelled misogynists by said outlets and journalists,
    and the shitstorm begins.
