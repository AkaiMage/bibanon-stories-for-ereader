* Type: Gas Explosive
* Ingredients: Explosive Gas

### Description

Under some conditions, common gases act as fuel. When mixed
with air, they will burn rapidly or even explode. For some
fuel-air mixtures, the range over which the explosion can
occur is quite wide while for others the limits are narrow.

The upper and lower amounts of common fuels that will cause
an ignitable mixture are shown in the table below. The
quantity shown is the percentage by volume of air. If the
fuel-air mixture is too lean or too rich, it will not
ignite. The amounts shown are therefore called limits of
inflamability.

### Comments

These fuels have been tested under labratory conditions.
They are effective. Ignition depends on method of
initiation, uniformity of mixture, and physical conditions.
