'''Zoom''' is a popular [[meme]] which involves pointing out an obvious grammatical error or spelling mistake in a post by screencapping the post, and posting images that slowly zoom into the error in question. However it is rare to see a "perfect" zoom were the zoom is uninterrupted by posts from other users. It was first seen in a spelling error in a crossplay thread and gained popularity a second thread where there were 3 "perfect" zooms in a single thread. The meme has also been adapted to pictures, in which bad anatomy, bizarre facial expressions, etc are zoomed. A text-only variant in which smaller and smaller portions of the zoomed post are quoted has also cropped up, but this version of zoom is far less impressive since it is done in a single post and thus can't be interrupted.
