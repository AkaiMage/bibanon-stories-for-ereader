The infamous spoiler of [[Final Fantasy VII]], now known to everyone other than a trio of monks in Tibet. Has resulted in a [[meme]] of "* DIES" image macros.

== Memes ==
=== 4CHAN DIES ===
A derivative of AERIS DIES, referencing the multiple "deaths" of [[4chan]] (4 to date, plus at least 2 near-death experiences), and usually posted to imply that another death is impending.

=== DYKE SPIES ===
Phonetic result of swapping the syllables in SPIKE DIES. Frequently used on /u/ to accompany threads featuring anime characters from Dirty Pair and Noir.

=== Jack Sparrow Dies ===
A retarded spoiler, following in the tradition of AERIS DIES, but failing horribly. Since the [[Pool's Closed|Habbo]] raids coincided with the opening weekend of Pirates of the Caribbean 2, the phrase was seen almost as much as "Pool's Closed" during the raids.

=== LADIES ===
: ''See: [[Death Note#LADIES|LADIES]]''
Death Note spoiler. The most recent version of AERIS DIES, this one takes on a more subtle note, as it requires the "A" to be crossed out in order for the actual message ("L DIES") to come through.

=== SPIKE DIES ===
Cowboy Bebop spoiler, nearly as infamous in the world of anime as AERIS DIES is in the world of video games. A popular [[meme]] posted in response to most Cowboy Bebop threads. Later resulted in the creation of a spin off meme, DYKE SPIES, through phonetic juxtaposition. '''SPIKE DIES, DYKE SPIES?''' is a common combination of these memes.
