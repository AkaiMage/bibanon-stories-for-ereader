## HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS

_BY ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX/MPG_

 This article deals with instructions on how to do some interesting
experiments with common household chemicals.  Some may or may not work
depending on the concentration of certain chemicals in different areas and
brands.  I would suggest that the person doing these experiments have some
knowledge of chemistry, especially for the more dangerous experiments.
