== General ==
* Alias: Silly_Axolotl, Silly-chan, Axolotl-chan, Cier-chan, Nancy, Sally Snake, and Silly.
* DOB: 06/03/1988
* Location: Minneapolis, Minnesota
* Place of Birth: South Dakota
* Favorite Drink: Coffee with sugar and cream, or hot tea with honey.

== Faggotry ==
* Her favorite sites include [[4chan]], flickr, [[Stickam]], [[LURKMORE]], Wikipedia, and sometimes deviantART. Her [http://www.nancy0.deviantart.com deviantART site] has been left out of hatred for the fact that the community of [[dA]] became a cold machine.
* Silly will be studying Graphic Design for four years in Minnesota, beginning October 2006. While she is not quite sure do with her bachelors degree when she gets it, she is more than certain that a great opportunity will present itself.
* Contrary to what she may wear while dancing around on cam, she enjoys getting gussied up in skirts and dresses. "Dressy", by her definition, doesn't mean "incredibly flashy". If she turns a head or two, it's enough to make her feel like she's dressed up.
* While not an avid gamer, Silly enjoys Tetris, Starcraft, and has recently downloaded Neverwinter Nights. She doubts if she's ever going to get around to playing it enough for it to be a part of her existance, but at least it's always an option if she wants to play something new.
* Somewhere around 11:00 on November 4, 2006, Silly received her first Stickam Raid from /b/.
* Her likes include: Warm colors (oranges, reds, yellows), photography, drawing, painting, laying around, hugs, sleeping, and the sound of rain.
* Silly actually hates the bullet-format of her wiki entry, yet is too lazy to find some way of putting it into a nice paragraph format.
* Dislikes include: Swimming, people who come on too strongly, people who are blatently intolerant, people who fuck up the space she just cleaned 15 minutes ago, chicken, not getting a good enough tip from tables at work, tornados, 'tards who need to lurk moar.
* Is not a trap.
* She has successfully convinced the internet that she is not actually an axolotl.  Truth be told, she is actually a ssilly ssssally ssssnakey ssssalamander.

== Vlog Episodes ==
Beginning Fall 2006, Silly began documenting little bits of her life in Minneapolis to make the transition from home to a place she had never even seen before a little easier emotionally.  As time went on, more and more people began enjoying them, so she continued to make some whenever she found time in her schedule.
'''NOTE:''' The episodes with "8D" by them are Silly's favorite vlogs.
