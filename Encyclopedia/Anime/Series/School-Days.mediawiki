A recent popular h-game and subsequent anime adaptation. ''School Days'' (the game) is unique in how, instead of the traditional text-on-screen visual novel style, features animated scenes separated by choices (though the animation quality usually leaves something to be desired). It became infamous among Japanese fans for possessing quality porn, slutty female characters, an impossibly pathetic male lead (even among h-game standards), and three shockingly bloody Bad Ends.

Despite the board at the time being mostly flooded by ''[[Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann|Gurren-Lagann]]'' and ''[[Lucky Star]]'', the anime adaptation of ''School Days'' managed to garner some attention on [[/a/]], as the animation studio seemingly went all out for shock value to generate some popularity. Because of this, the anime features a ridiculously high amount of sex (though nothing on screen that would please /a/nonymous, of course) and an even bloodier Bad End than any of the slaughters depicted in the game. This has given /a/ mixed feelings about the show, as the main bulk of it is considered horrible melodrama on an almost soap-opera level, while the ending caused some of the most murderous lulz /a/ has experienced in quite some time.

=== Makoto Ito ===
The main male character of the recent h-game and anime School Days, and one of the more divisive figures on /a/. Spent most of his time in the anime hooking up with a number of girls from his class before being brutally murdered in the finale. Makoto is loathed by a majority of [[/a/]]ssholes for mistreating the women in his show and for being an all-around dick, and there was considerable rejoicing on /a/ following his demise. Simply put, every School Days thread is a "Hate Makoto" thread (as well as a [[Nice Boat]] thread). Despite this, Makoto has a small following on /a/ (Who get brushed off as trolls by most nearly all denizens of /a/), with his fans crediting him for being one of the few men in anime to actually get laid, subsequently calling him manly and [[GAR]] (usually dubbing him MANkoto).

This following has taken up the extremely annoying practice of photoshopping Makoto's head (badly) onto other male leads when surrounded by their harem, images of manly/godly men or other such images that would imply great manliness if only Makoto hadn't fucked it up (sort of like an offshoot of the [[Pimp]] meme, except on a wider and far more obnoxious scale). In return, haters have created both shops of Makoto's face during his brutal murder or fanfictions of Makoto trying to get with girls in other (less slutty) anime with [http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=5991267&x=makoto+fanfiction hillarious results]. Overall, Makoto threads will more often than not create shitstorms of a magnitude that is rarely seen on /a/ (almost hitting or even surpassing [[Lucky Star]] levels) between haters, fans, and, of course, trolls, and as such are the source of much DRAMA and lulz.

While Makoto was nominated by his followers to be in [[GAR#SaiGar|SaiGAR]] 08, his round proved how his fangroup is basically made up of nothing more than a few devoted trolls, as he lost by 200 votes, despite being up against an anti-GAR figure in L from Death Note and a random Gundam pilot. All said, between the [[Fag|faggotry]] roused by his fanbase and the impossibly annoying Makoto shoops, Makoto has more or less cemented his role as the most aggravating forced meme on [[/a/]] since [[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya#Viral Marketing|viral marketing]] and [[One Piece#Set fail for One Piece|Set fail for One Piece]].
