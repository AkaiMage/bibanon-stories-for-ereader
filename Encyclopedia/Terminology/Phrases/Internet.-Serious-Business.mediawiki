"'''Internet. Serious Business.'''" is a highly popular [[meme]]. Evolved from "'''The Internet is serious business.'''" and has since transformed into any word or phrase followed by "'''Serious business.'''", or even just "'''Serious Business'''" with no preceding phrase. Comes from the belief that what happens on [[Internet]] forums (message boards, lists, Usenet, etc.) is usually inconsequential and not worth dwelling on; used as a sarcastic observation on an overheated thread, or as a hint to the [[original poster]] that they should drop the subject and move on.
