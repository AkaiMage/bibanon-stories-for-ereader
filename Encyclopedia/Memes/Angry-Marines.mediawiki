[[Image:Angrymarines.jpg|right|thumb|Angry Marines: Always angry, all the time.]]
Originally created by a [[Fag|tripfag]] who played ''Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War'' as a custom army, lead by Commissar John Fuklaw, consisting of a Chapter of Space Marines with red and yellow paintjob and who were perpeptually angry, taking a giant yellow '''>:C''' face as their banner.

Adopted by /tg/ as one of several mascots (alongside Shadowsun and Commissar Kharn) and are always shown in a poorly drawn, cartoony style, but also shown kicking copius amounts of foul Xenos and Heretical ass.

The Angry Marines are always angry.

Always.
