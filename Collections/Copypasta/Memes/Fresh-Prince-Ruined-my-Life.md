## Fresh Prince Ruined my Life ##

Fresh prince of Bel-air has ruined my life. I memorised the entire of the theme tune and started randomly using it in everyday conversation out of habit.
Relationships have started to fall apart, and people have started to avoid me.
I don't even try to use it any more. It just comes out, subconsiously. /b/ and Will Smith have ruined my fucking life.
