'''Blockatiel''' refers to pictures (often erotic or pornographic) with a cockatiel photoshopped into them. Some might say that it was based off of the less humorous "[[Covercat]]". Blockatiel pictures are normally accompanied by phrases such as "Blockatiel saves your soul" or "Blockatiel haets nueds".  Was considered a [[:Category:Forced and Failed Memes|forced meme]] at the time, but subsequently forgotten.

In early 2009, Blockatiel earned true meme status when an [[Anonymous]] brought him back to fight Advice Dog and Courage Wolf threads.
