== History ==
Fug-chan was, as her title implies, a fugly camwhore (yet thankfully shortlived) that posted during May of 2008. Once she started posting her first pics, a shitstorm of trolls lined up to force her to leave. Not taking hints, Fug-chan still posted nudes; compliments given by dim-witted basement dwellers fueled her presence. Eventually, the mods stepped in. Her thread was finally deleted from [[CHANSLUTS]] after the mods decided they could no longer stand her face and body, not to mention the constant whining.
