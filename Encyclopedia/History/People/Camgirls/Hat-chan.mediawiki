Who is Hat-chan, and where did she come from? This is the ultimate question that all [[/b/]]tards have.

It is unknown when Hat-chan first appeared on [[/b/]], but many sources point to a sticky flood, where her picture was posted over and over and over. Since then, she has shown up all across /b/, as well as in numerous threads in [[/s/]] and [[/r/]].

Despite only one known picture of her circulating, and no contact information, Hat-chan has amassed a sizable following on [[/b/]]. Whenever threads of people wearing extravagant military hats (usually Russian, or various international naval hats) appear on [[/b/]], a counter pic starring Hat-chan will show up soon afterwards, with Hat-chan shooting laser beams out of her eyes at the challenger.
