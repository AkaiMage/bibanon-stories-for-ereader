Here's a GREAT little trick to play on your best fiend (no thats not a typo) at skool, or maybe as a practial joke on a friend!

## Materials Needed

* One Ball Point `Click` pen
* Gun Powder
* 8 or 10 match heads
* 1 Match stick
* a sheet of sand paper (1 1/2" X 2")

1. Unscrew pen and remove all parts but leave the button in the top.
2. Stick the match stick in the part of the pen clicker where the other little 
   parts and the ink fill was.
3. Roll sand paper up and put around the match stick that is in the clicker.
4. Put the remaining Match Heads inside the pen, make sure that they are on
   the inside on the sand paper.
5. Put a small piece of paper or something in the other end of the pen where
   the ball point comes out.
6. Fill the end with the piece of paper in it with gun powder.  The paper is
   to keep the powder from spilling.

The Finished pen should look like this:
