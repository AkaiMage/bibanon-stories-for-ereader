Common response to posts that are meant to be clever or funny. As many other responses like "O RLY", this has taken on mutliple, and even contradictory meanings.
# The post is too obviously derived from something else (usually whatever forced [[meme]] is making the rounds at the time) and thus not quite as amusing as it could have been, or it's just too plain hard to understand.
# At first I didn't see what was funny about that, but now I do. Nice job. Synononym: An image macro saying "At first I was like.. " (Serious look) "But then I LOLd" (laughing face).
# HA HA HA!
