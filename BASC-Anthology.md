## LP Archive
A "Let's Play" is a playthrough of a video game that is recorded and shared with the public. Although no better known for the numerous Youtube LPs (and in fact many of the LPs on the archive are in video format), there are also LPs using screenshots and text, or even hybrids of both formats.

   * Animal Crossing is a series of games where the player settles in a small town. You can pick fruit, dig up fossils, catch insects, fish, and interact with the locals. All of your efforts are to repay your crippling debt to the local friendly store owner, Tom Nook, after which he expands your house without your consent and charges you an even higher debt. Sounds peaceful and boring? **It won't be.**
