*Internet history is surprisingly quite as interesting as any description of World history, full of illustrous individuals, crushing wars, and the rise and fall of powerful websites.*

* [[Introduction|Internet History]] - But of course, where to start? This article will tell you the basics of how the internet came together, and will direct you to other pages that tell a more in-depth story.

## Help out

The articles linked on this page is a fraction of the pages we actually have. Please check the [[Git]] repository and link to some of these articles if possible.

## Sections

* [[Sites]] - A set of articles with some history about a few important sites on the internet.
* [[Groups]] - A list of historically important groups on the internet.
* [[People]] - A list of historically important people on the internet.
* [[Lawmaking]] - Proposed or implemented laws and representatives that affect the internet in any significant manner.

## The Beginning

* [[The WELL]] - The ideas we hold true in our forums and social networks started here in this groundbreaking BBS.
* [[USENET]] - A special university-based BBS that had the option to be pseudo-anonymous. This place oversaw the cultivation of the Free Software movement, which ended up turning the GNU Project, now made complete with Linux, into a tangible product.

## Anonymous Imageboards

*Anonymous Imageboards are a strange, but culturally important anamoly in internet history.*

### Forerunners

* [[Ayashii World]] - *needs translation* The first anonymous textboard ever made on the internet, which bore a large community known as Nanashi World. [[4chan]] and [[Anonymous]] draw strong parallels to it's community, and it is actually a direct descendant, at least when it comes to the code.
* [[2channel]] - The largest textboard ever built on the internet, larger than [[2chan]] and 4chan combined. It is nearly equal to the media in cultural importance.
* [[2ch History]] - A basic outline of 2ch History by JKid of the [[Yotsuba Society]].
* [[2ch History Timeline]] - *needs translation* A complete timeline of 2channel history. It's from the Japanese Wikipedia, and needs to be translated to English.
* [[world2ch]] - An attempt to bring the concept of anonymous textboard beyond Japan. It was a world where Japanese and English-speakers alike mingled together for the first, and last time. 
* [[Futaba Channel]] - An anonymous imageboard designed as the successor to 2channel. 4chan's codebase was directly descended from this site.
* [[Something Awful]] - The site that gave 4chan it's community and culture should not itself be forgotten. These articles will unlock the paywall and allow us to understand what happened and what resided here, and how it fell into irrelevance later on. 

### 4chan

* [[4chan Chronicle]] - The epic story of one of the most interesting(ly controversial) communities ever to exist on the Internet.
* [[4chan History Timeline]] - A nice, though somewhat incomplete timeline of how 4chan developed. Written by a random redditor, it was narrowly saved from being lost with the second [[Wikichan|Wiki#Wikichan]], and now resides here.
* [[4chan]] - A better article on how and why 4chan and it's community grew, and how it became so influential to modern internet culture today.

### Other Chans

### Books

* [[4chan History]] - Our plan to create a better, textbook version of 4chan history, created by actual users of the site.
* [[Epic Win for Anonymous]] - Cole Stryker's look at the history and importance of 4chan. He risked life and limb in the attempt to document what few even cared about: The history of 4chan. While he means well, as a meme racketeer and relative newfag, he brings up little other than public knowledge. It's a good read nonetheless.

## [[Anonymous]]

*It's hard to sum it up in one sentence, but it's basically the personification of the internet.*

* [[Anonymous]] - An unwritten article about Anonymous.
* [[Anonymous History Timeline]] - This article is based on the one on Wikipedia. It details major events in [[Anonymous]]'s history, but is a mess of cite notes. We need to turn this into something like the [[4chan History Timeline]].

### Books

* [[Rise of Anonymous]] - A plan to create a book about Anonymous's history, made by anons, for anons. For a while, [[Anonymous]]'s history parallels that of the site that bore it, 4chan. But as time went on, they went their seperate ways into a new future after [[Project Chanology]]. Exactly how did Anonymous come about, and what can we learn about successful raids in the past? 

## General Internet Culture

* [[Significant Memes]] - A simple collection of articles describing all the memes that we held dear years ago and have forgotten today. It takes the descriptions of [[ED|Encyclopedia Dramatica]], [[LURKMOAR Wiki]], and condenses the basics into something that will explain old memes to users easily. 
* [[Significant Raids]] - A sprawling description of raids that have been done by various groups on the internet, with in-depth coverage on how it was done.
