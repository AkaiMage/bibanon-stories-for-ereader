## General Report

*General description about the incident for people to get up to date; because things move fast*

*(quick and dirty intro, needs more work)* 

Five Guys. Zoe Quinn screwed with Five Guys. True, scandalous relationships is hardly anyone else's business. 

But as proven from time immemorial: sex can be a potent force for manipulation. And what Zoe did was to use sly tactics to exploit the rampant corruption that exists in the game journalism industry.

*(write something about the uncovering of rampant corruption in the game industry as a result. Make sure you have solid sources. 10/10 IGN)*

This scandal is hardly an isolated incident... *(Insert words here)*

*(write about Zoe's false and fabricated accusations of Wizardchan raiding her)*

*(write about Zoe's suppression of TFYC in favor of her own non charity effort)*

After discovering that Zoe tried to crush TFYC, /v/ and /pol/ launched Operation Chemo to fund the TFYC she hated so much; to bring attention to Zoe’s blatant hypocrisy; and most of all, to fight back against Zoe in a way that prevents 4chan from playing into her hands.

When TFYC recommended that /v/ create a new game character for them as a token of support; /v/ came up with a bunch of unsavory designs, until they eventually decided on the one that looked the most normal; Vivian James. 

The design of Vivian James gained resounding support for being utterly atypical of 4chan, and /v/ quickly adopted her as their musume (daughter).

Operation Chemo has currently hit an unexpected rut after TFYC’s Indiegogo was hacked by unknown forces on 8/24, throwing the entire project into disarray. 

*"United we stand. Divided we fall."*
