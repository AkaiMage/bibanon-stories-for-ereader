'''leekspin''' is a [[swf]] file from some time in 2006. In the loop, an anime girl ([[Orihime Inoue]] from [[Bleach]]) spins a leek. The clip of music in the swf is from '''Loituma's Ievan Polkka'''. Loituma, a Finnish band, was made known to outsiders and became quite popular locally due to leekspin's popularity.

As stated above, the [[Flash]] loop appeared some time in 2006, which is around the time when pretty much anything interesting happened in regards to [[4chan]].
