[[4chan]] is hands-down one of the most interesting and influential websites ever created. It functions as the America of popular culture on the internet, the ultimate source for most internet memes, and a beacon of anonymity in a world that is becoming more socially invasive.

The site influenced a new generation of major internet figures and coders, continues to birth to memes that are now common staples on most major websites and even common speech, and cultivated a flock of loosely organized people led only by a common goal, known as [[Anonymous]].

This book has the goal of detailing the complete history of 4chan in the format of a conventional college-level history book, with a touch of humor common to that site.

## Help

We've got a lot of information already, but we need hard facts and primary sources from people who actually experienced the era discussed. If you have anything to add, no matter how small, get in here and do it.

The [[4chan History Timeline]] is a great source of information, though it thins out near the end of 2007. Cole Stryker's [[Epic Win For Anonymous]] is also awesome, though it comes from an carpetbagger's point of view.

## Periods

4chan's history is to be divided into concurrent periods, like that of Japanese history. Each era was dominated by different immigrant groups from other websites, who imported the memes of their culture into the melting pot.

* [[Prehistory|4chan-Prehistory]] _(1996-2003)_ - The background of the world that 4chan was started in, and was influenced by.
* [[Genesis|4chan Genesis]] _(Sept 2003 - Mar 2004)_ - 4chan is founded, bringing the unique experience of anonymous imageboards to the English language world. It instantly finds supporters in Something Awful's ADTRW board, and slowly surpasses it's predecessor.
* [[Mootxico Era|4chan Mootxico Era]] _(Apr 2004 - Sept 2005)_ - 4chan inherits it's traditions, and initial memes from 2channel, Something Awful, and the rest of the internet and creates a powerful meme-based culture that stands out from the crowd.
* [[Civil War Era|4chan Civil War Era]] _(Oct 2005 - Nov 2006)_ - 4chan's growing popularity comes with massive social change, caused by problematic subcultures, a new raid mentality, and romanticism for an idyllic depiction of /b/. These tensions culminate in /b/day, a mass revolt by /b/tards incited by moot's enforcement of rules on /b/.
* [[Golden Age|4chan Golden Age]] _(Dec 2006 - Dec 2007)_ - Users seeking refuge in other sites after /b/day take 4chan's memes and unique attitude with them, kicking off 4chan's Golden Age. These memes are quickly integrated into mainstream internet culture, inspiring interest in the website that started it all. Reception is mixed; 4chan becomes the focal site of the internet, but at the cost of having it's memes monetized and mangled by outsiders and carpetbaggers. Population sharply increases, and so does the amount of great content from the era.
* [[Chanology Era|4chan Chanology Era]] _(Jan 2008 - Jan 2009)_ - When Scientologists take down a ridiculous training video posted to Youtube, 4chan fights back in full force as [[Anonymous]] in [[Project Chanology]]. The sheer strength of the attack inaugurates a new era of organized internet protest. 
* [[Boxxy Era|4chan Boxxy Era]] _(Jan 2009 - )_ - By this time, Anonymous has largely reassimilated into 4chan, falling dormant until the next crisis. A new queen of /b/ arises, causing a second civil war that nearly brings 4chan to it's knees. The rise of [[Reddit]] fosters an uneasy, but symbiotic cultural relationship between the two similar, yet different sites. 
* [[Payback Era|4chan Payback Era]] _(2010-2011)_ - Anonymous gets right back in action in Operation Payback when Aiplex Software was found to have DDoSed torrent sites under orders of the MPAA. While they succeed in destroying the company, the [[Wikileaks]] scandal greatly lengthens the operation, and the [[Arab Spring]] forces perpetual mobilization. Anonymous has become a force to be reckoned with, but it's former home 4chan, suspicious of their new face, motives, and organization, has long since disowned them.
  * At this point, [[Anonymous]]'s history permanently divests itself of 4chan history, and it is treated as an independent community. It continues on [[Anonymous History]].
* [[Pony Era]] _(2011 -)_ The pony apocalypse affects 4chan, leading to the creation of the pony board.
* [[Modernization Era]] (2012 -)The 4chan image boards undergo a massive code redesign, leader to a better 4chan overall, and the addition of mobile versions of the site for phones and tablets.

The last one was maintained by a Redditor on the second [[Wikichan]], but it was lost with the site's downfall and saved out of chance.
