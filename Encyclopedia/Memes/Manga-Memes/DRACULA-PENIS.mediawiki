Seen in threads featuring art by the Japanese H-artist Yozora, all of whose girls are vampires, and most of whom sport an enormous penis. Also has drawn some [[guro]] of said [[vampire dickgirls]] being impaled with crosses or swords. The artist is frequently lambasted for the vast majority of the girls having the exact same facial expression (mouth wide open and displaying fangs, tongue sticking out, undersized and disproportional eyes staring into space or at the camera). Interestingly, since [[/d/]]eviants first complained about it, most of the work produced by the artist has the girls with different facial expressions. Whether this is coincidence or word somehow got to Yozora, who then took it as constructive criticism, has not been determined.
