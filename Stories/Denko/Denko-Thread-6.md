##OP  
Making a new thread here for now. (´･ω･`)  
  
##OP  
Okay, time to continue… (´･ω･`)  

So I was waving at Denko waiting for her to come this way.  
But then Denko threw her bag at me really hard, and I ducked to dodge it.  
But in the next moment, Denko screamed and kicked me right in the chin.  
It was so unlike her, it absolutely stunned me…  
I never would have dreamed I’d get kicked by Denko.  
So I quickly grabbed Denko’s hand to stop her rampaging.  
Right? Since it was just a misunderstanding? (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
SHINING WIZARD!!  
  
###2ch  
DENKO GJ  
  
###2ch  
Denko’s had a whole lot of stress built up…  
I’m not surprised she’d get violent, no matter what you said to her.  
  
###2ch  
Then what? What about A-ko?  
And everyone else involved?  
  
###2ch  
Holy shit Denko! We’re proud of you, girl!  
I’d been imagining her as a weakling since all we know is she’s being stalked, but damn was I wrong…  
  
###2ch  
Is it possible the friend who showed up in the thread was A-ko?  
They had details on the flower-viewing incident, too.  
  
###2ch  
If it was A-ko, it seems weird she’d say “What did you do to Denko?”, doesn’t it?  
Since A-ko is selling info to the OP.  
The part about “threatening with violence,” too, since Denko used the Shining Wizard on OP.  
  
Maybe A-ko is the final boss? If this is like an RPG?  
  
##OP  
SORRY I GOT A CALL FROM A-KO.  
She said she had good info, but when I said I would be hard up for cash this month, she hung up on me… (´･ω･`)  
I’m talking with my mom now.  
  
##OP  
Okay, sorry for going off-topic.  
I’ve been sorting things out, so I was late with this… (´･ω･`)  
  
So Denko was getting violent and I grabbed her hand, but she screamed really loud.  
I immediately thought, oh no, she misunderstood me again, so I got on the ground and started apologizing.  
I think it got through to Denko, because then she broke down crying.  
But then A-ko (the one who gave me info on Denko) came with some other girl I don’t know, and they suddenly pushed us apart… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
I’m serious, stop posting your made-up crap on 2chan!  
  
People, don’t believe a word this guy says about what happened today!  
  
###2ch  
^ Well, I believe him more than you, since there’s actually something TO believe.  
  
#2ch  
^ Is this A-ko?  
  
###2ch  
^ Compared to you going “NO YOU’RE WRONG,” I’m going with the OP, who’s at least starting to talk.  
Because anybody can just say “nope, that’s not true.”  
  
###2ch  
I’ve heard all of OP’s story, so I want to hear this person’s too, but there’s one thing I want to ask.  
  
What do you think about A-ko selling info to OP despite knowing Denko despises him?  
  
###2ch  
^ I don’t believe it. It’s just a fabrication by the OP!  
And Denko would never get violent!  
This guy is seriously messed in the head!  
  
###2ch  
^ Stop trying to be emotional about this, okay?  
Why else would OP know the time, place, and so on of the flower-viewing?  
And the changed email addresses and phone numbers? It’s probably even why he got busted.  
I know lots of women tend to dodge questions like this, but doing this is just being pointlessly cruel to Delico, okay?  
  
###2ch  
DELICO.  
  
###2ch  
^ OH GOD I DIED AT “DELICO”  
  
##OP  
So they shouted at me, calling me a pervert…  
And even A-ko told me “Don’t get any closer to Denko!”  
It’s not something I expected at all… It made me cry from shock…  
And when Denko asked what I want from her, I was sobbing and saying I just want us two to talk! (´･ω･`)  
Then it was silent for a while, and Denko said that as long as A-ko and ___ were watching, she would listen.  
And then I realized…  
Right! I had to confess under the cherry blossoms!  
  
###2ch  
This guy is really something if he thinks “I should confess!” after all that.  
  
##OP  
So then I led Denko under a cherry blossom within sight of A-ko and the mystery girl.  
Then I casually pushed Denko from behind under the tree.  
I wanted to talk about my feelings, and how Denko was misunderstanding me.  
Of course, I was thinking of all these things to say to lead up to confessing to Denko.  
And I was sweating so much it was getting in my eyes, so Denko gave me a handkerchief.  
But the next moment, Denko suddenly said, before I could confess…  
"There’s someone I like, and I’m sorry, ___, but it isn’t you."  
It was so out of left field, like I had been suddenly hit with a baseball bat… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
Whoa, man, that’s rough. What happened next?  
  
##OP  
Thank you… (´･ω･`) It was such a rough day, I didn’t even eat…  
  
Denko told me “If you’re really thinking about me, please, consider how I feel.”  
So I was glad to hear that Denko knew I thought about her more than anything else.  
But I really despised this guy that Denko liked… (I’ll have to get info on him from A-ko…)  
I never considered for a second Denko would care for anyone but me, so it was a huge shock.  
So Denko shook my hand, made me promise not to come near her again, and we went home.  
  
###2ch  
Keep that goddamn promise…  
  
###2ch  
SHIT DUDE RUN  
  
###2ch  
Have you yet to tell Denko about how you’re so devoted, you’re paying A-ko to hear more about her??  
  
I mean, if I were a girl, I’d be moved to tears by that.  
  
##OP  
A-ko’s still giving me info about Denko.  
If I cut things off with A-ko, I’d be really stuck… (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
I thought you said you didn’t fully trust A-ko?  
Why’s OP being so careful with A-ko?  
  
##OP  
BECAUSE SHE SAYS DENKO DOESN’T LIKE ME. (´･ω･`)  
  
###2ch  
But that’s true… ROFL  
  
###2ch  
I really don’t know how you could raise a kid this effed in the head.  
  
###2ch  
Looks like this is over.  
Break up, guys.  
  
###2ch  
OP sure is being slow…  
  
I’m getting kind of worried.  
  
###2ch  
All the other threads ended this way too.  
Give it some time and he’ll make another thread.  
'Cause he's a troll.  
  
###2ch  
These threads never have a satisfying ending…
