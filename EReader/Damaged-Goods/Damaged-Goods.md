<img align="right" src="Amputee-chan.png" width="200px">

*Damaged Goods* is a classic from 4chan's (supposedly) "Golden Age" (2006-2007) where a registered male nurse (dubbed "Nurse-kun") asked /b/ for advice when his boring everyday life in a nursing home was interrupted by the arrival of a badly hurt 7-year-old girl. 

At first he merely thought this an interesting anecdote, flavoring it to get the attention of the "fucked-up" /b/tards known as Anonymous, but in an uncharacteristic change of heart, some anons pressed him to actually help the little girl out.

As the events unfold, the magic of the story somehow enchanted the cold heart of Anonymous. The people famous for mercilessly crushing 12-year old girls convinced Nurse-kun to grant the broken soul one friend in the world, and to save her from an unfortunate end. One thing led to another, and for once, the legions of Anonymous found themselves giving the little girl something to smile about. 

It does more than just tell a riveting tale about one guy and a girl; it gives a window into what 4chan was, what this influential community became, and what the site truly meant to the users who lurked and posted at the time. 

## Chapters

With the discovery of the [all the original 4chan threads](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22186524/Wikichan-Damaged-Goods-Archive.7z), we can fill in the blanks as to exactly who and what Nurse-kun was replying to, creating a **Remastered Edition** that brings a new angle of the story. *These had previously been omitted, due to Wikichan's mad rush to winnow out the story from the trolling.*

There are 23 chapters/threads in this story. Nurse-kun's first post on 4chan's /b/ appeared on the 17th of December, 2006, and had been updated regularly thereafter until June 2nd of 2007, when the posting stopped abruptly.

## Saving the story

A (non)Danish anon known as Sarafan followed the threads in real time as the story unfolded, and worked tirelessly to save the story for future generations.

The threads were documented in real time on Wikichan, where it was dubbed "Damaged Goods". However after a server crash, all of the fanart was lost and the story was almost lost forever. Thankfully, Shii managed to save the entirety of the wikipages beforehand, until his website was itself shut down.

The original threads were uploaded to temporary download sites where they were soon lost, but Sarafan had a long-lost archive with everything in it up his sleeve. The Bibliotheca Anonoma discovered [Sarafan's complete 4chan thread archive](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22186524/Wikichan-Damaged-Goods-Archive.7z) out of serendipity, 2 days before Megaupload's infamous takedown. 

And from there, we have created the **Remastered Edition**, restoring the story to it's original glory.

## Reactions

<img align="right" src="lolied.jpg" width="200px">

His /b/ threads have become 4chan legend, and his legacy is heavily debated to this day. The two or three hundred replies his posts receive in each thread fall into roughly one of seven categories:

1. I don't Habeeb it!
2. You are a sick, sick fuck. Spam mode activated.
3. Your story warms my heart.
4. Your story inspires my life.
5. Your story inspires my life because I am a Pedophile.
6. ???
7. PROFIT!

### A Challenge to Nurse-kun

On December 14, 2007, Shii received an anonymous tip from a professional statistician who was convinced Nurse-kun's story was fake. In the United States, car accidents are tabulated in a national database called the Fatality Analysis Reporting System|http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx (FARS). You can go to the FARS database yourself and query their results for 2006 and 2005. Very few children were extracted from cars. The guy claimed he couldn't find anyone matching Nurse-kun's description at all. Use the database yourself and see if you can determine Nurse-kun's home state. 

* <s>Case 28-441 in 2005 (Coil Town, Mississippi). 3 occupants, 2 deaths. 5-year-old girl extracted from car with an incapacitating injury and taken to hospital. Currently living. Crash occurred July 24, 2005.</s> Ruled out, this was a single father and two children.
* <s>Case 54-188 in 2005 (Charleston, West Virginia). 3 occupants, 2 deaths. 5-year-old girl extracted from car with an incapacitating injury and taken to hospital. Currently living. Crash occurred July 21, 2005.</s> Ruled out: 

> Comment by C. Reed: (regarding case 54-188: the mother did not die) "Man and toddler die in crash; 5-year old child injured" ... Anyway, if the story was true, there would be news reports about it somewhere given that local news will report on every fatal car wreck.

And indeed, it was.

### Nurse-kun in DC

Comment by J. Stone: *I believe I have found out the location of nurse-kun and ampu-tan I am 90% sure that they are located somewhere around Washington DC.*

> For the first outing in chapter 16 they went to the Kennedy Center for Performing arts (Which in 1992 was renovated to be more handicapped accessible) The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum I am not that sure about the library though.  
> Next in chapter 19 for the hockey game they went to the Version center which hosts the Washington Capitols.  
> And finally in chapter 21 when they went on their walk it was at the Tidal Basin and or West Potomac Park which as Nurse-kun stated is usually packed with people watching the cherry blossoms bloom. 

## Characters

### Nurse-kun

<img align="right" src="nurse-kun.jpg" width="300px">

> “...I did kind of... want to help her.
> I thought about the alternative: I could, of course, do nothing.
> She would be my patient, and I would be her nurse.
> A very professional relationship, but...
> What would become of her?”
> *— Nurse-kun*

A young registered nurse, he sees life in it's worst everyday. As a professional he deals with it as it comes along, but that was before he saw her. Now with a yearning to help beyond the call of duty, he continues to provide support for a fragile life.

Obviously, he was an active user of 4chan, but not a lot is known about him since he keeps his anonymity for security and safety purposes. He does tell us that he's in his twenties and is a male registered nurse who works at a nursing home during the late shift.

### Amputee-chan ###

> I have no future. Nobody wants me anymore.
> *- Amputee-chan*

Amputee-chan is the adopted child of the anon known as Nurse-kun.
According to his story she is half-Norwegian, half-Japanese, blond, green eyed, and missing both legs above the knees due to a car crash. She is also missing her right arm below the elbow. With her immediate family dead, and her relatives leaving her for dead, she has been abandoned in a nursing home as a ward of the state.

She enjoys gaming, teddy bears, and beating up racist shitheads. Turn offs include nightmares about her dead parents, losing at DDR, and professional behavior on the part of medical professionals.

### Anonymous ###

> Adopt her?
> *- Anonymous 12/16/06(Sat)14:38:47 No.17396289*

Something was different today. For once, the /b/tards who called themselves Anonymous did not display their typical face.

While they ramble in some "colorful" discussions (In the thread right before they were dumping CP), Nurse-kun's story led Anonymous to respond with a mix array of emotive replies, sharing Nurse-kun's desire to heal. Anonymous even drew some nice pictures for Amputee-chan in an effort to make the girl happy, and for once in her life she actually laughed.

### Desu Girl ###

> Oh OP, you were always so romantic.
> *- Desu Girl 12/17/06(Sun)14:05:55 No.17445916*

An recurring character who claims to be Amputan from the year 2026, to hilarious effect. Desu Girl foreshadows Nurse-kun's change in attitude from helpless observer to benevolent father figure. Her posts were not archived on Wikichan and were only recently discovered with the original thread archives.

### Sarafan ###

A sysop of Wikichan who tirelessly archived each thread of Nurse-kun's story. Before the 4chanarchive was created, people like Sarafan were the only ones keeping records of 4chan's greatest stories and achievements.

*Also, one of his secret archives held the original html dumps of exactly what the threads looked like, along with all the fanart. We owe a lot to this /b/tard.*

### Shii ###

Full Article: Shii

> I wrote the suck-ass anonymous message board software that they (4chan) still use today, despite never having taken a programming class ever.
> *- Shii*

A very significant person, engineer, and admin in Something Awful's ADTRW, world2ch, and early 4chan. He claims to have gotten 4chan's 10MGET, (hazukiget), and was a major proponent in the use of anonymous BBS systems. He sometimes posted anonymously to Nurse-kun's threads, and drew one of the fan art.

Due to the incompetence of Wikichan's admins, it's content was habitually lost every year and spammed into oblivion in the middle. Right before Wikichan went down for good, Shii saved this story to his own site. Without this guy, the story of Nurse-kun would have been damned to oblivion.


## Trivia

### Misc.

* Nurse-kun probably gave the girl a [Terry's Chocolate Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry%27s_Chocolate_Orange). These are pretty god damn tasty, but as in the story, they are a rather difficult candy to open, thus why he "broke" it beforehand.
* Nurse-kun also gave the girl a small hand-sized Teddy Bear. This is a damn fine idea for a gift for a ~7 year old.

### Loli haet pizza

![Loli haet pizza](lolihaetpizza.png)

> ...no. I don't like pizza.
> --Ampu-tan

Loli haet pizza is an ancient meme with an uncertain origin. It's likely that the original author intended to say, lol i hate pizza, but she or he forgot to press the space key, resulting in 4chan's most epic typo.

### Elfen Lied
**Nana's Everyday Life**

Elfen Lied is somewhat a harem anime crossed with guro (Grotesque or more known as Gore), which makes it appealing for some. It's mostly about a girl called Nyu/Lucy who's a mysterious and deadly breed of horned humans called diclonius. She comes to live with a guy called Kouta.

Lucy/Nyu are two separate personalities of a single girl. Lucy is a cold blooded insane killer, product of cruel experiments at the mutant research facility. Nyu on the other hand is opposite of Lucy; innocent and incapable of violence. Nyu came about after a .50 BMG round ricocheted off a metallic helmet encasing her head. When Nyu is attacked violently, she regresses to Lucy. Like wise when Lucy is treated with love and kindness, she will uncontrollably switch back to Nyu.

Nana is another diclonius who Lucy dismembered in a violent outburst at the research facility. She lost all her limbs but eventually learned to use prosthetic appendages with her telekinetic powers.

Nana's Everyday Life is a disturbing (and thus considered awesome) web comic by Dan Kim with Nana as the main character. Dan Kim have a sick sense of humour and it shows up in NEL and his other works, which endears them to the typical /b/tard since 4chan pretty much revolves around that kind of humour. Conversely Dan seems to be a bit of a /b/tard himself and /b/ memes often end up in his manga. (a certain bear, one of the mascots of /b/ even appeared in Nana's Everyday Life).

Unlike her counterpart in Elfen Lied, in NEL Nana does not learn how to use prosthetics. Readers of Nurse-kun's story were quick to point out to him some of the parallels between NEL and Damaged Goods. After reading NEL, Nurse-kun personally stated that "fictions will remain that way, if I have anything to say about it."

### Ghost in the Shell
**Motoko Kusanagi**

Nurse-kun has apparently seen this anime, and the origami crane scenes within it. This inspired him to suggest origami activities to Amputee-chan.

Motoko was nine years old when she was severely injured in a plane crash. The other survivor of the crash was a six year old boy named Hideo Kuze. As Kuze lies in his bed, he felt sorry for Motoko lying in her bed next to him in a coma. The reason for his emotion was because he know she will never recover. So with the only functional part of his body left; his left hand, he started folding paper cranes for her. According to Japanese legend if a thousand cranes are made, a wish would be granted.

To save Motoko, a procedure was carried out on her to replace her dying body with a fully cybernetic one. After recovering, Motoko returned to Kuze. Kuze asked her if it was possible to make paper crane with a cybernetic body. Motoko tried but failed as she was unable to adapt to the fine motor skills of her new prosthetic parts. She left Kuze and promised to return when she was able to fold cranes. Soon afterwards Kuze underwent the same cybernetic process.

Later in the series, taking place many years after, both Motoko and Kuze were seen on occasions to fold paper cranes single-handedly as they've grown accustomed to their new bodies.

### Densha Otoko (Train Man)

Some people have pointed out that Nurse-kun's story may well become 4chan's version of Densha Otoko. Densha Otoko was originally an ongoing story on the Japanese forum 2ch. The story goes that an otaku who with the help of other posters of 2ch managed to break out of his shell and propose to a girl after saving her from a drunk on a train. This story has gone stupidly popular in Japan, to the extent of spawning a movie, TV series, manga, novel and whatnot based on it.

While 4chan has had epic threads in it's history, none of them has come anywhere near the celebrity status of Densha Otoko. The ongoing nature of Nurse-kun's story and how anonymous was giving advice to him draw many parallels between the two stories.

Of course, the difference in the nature of the two story could probably attest to the difference in atmosphere between 2ch and 4chan. If Densha Otoko came to ask for advice on /b/ on 4chan, we would have to wonder what kind of advice he would of encountered. (Barrel rolls and S.I.I.H.P. comes to mind)

### Elite Beat Agents/Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan

Elite Beat Agents is a Nintendo DS game which Nurse-kun plays with Amputee-chan. It is an American remake of a Japanese game called Osu! Takakae! Ouendan (roughtly Go! Fight! Cheersquad.)

The main characters of Elite Beat Agents are members of a fictional government agency responsible for helping those in need. When someone facing a crisis reaches the end of their rope and cries out for help, the agents arrive on the scene to help them succeed. Through the dancing of the agents, the people they came to help are instilled with motivation that helps them overcome various obstacles. Ouendan is similar in this aspect but where they differ is that Ouendan are an all male cheering squad (in which Japanese schools actually support) that come to the aid and commence their manly cheering.

The Christmas stage in EBA which Nurse-kun was worried about, is about the agents assisting a young girl in reuniting with the spirit of her deceased father. Since it was around Christmas when Amputee-chan was playing EBA, and her parents died recently in a car crash, one could understand why this stage might be a bit too close to home.

At the planetarian, I mean, planetarium, the song that Nurse-kun and Amputee-chan laugh at and sing together is called "Jumpin' Jack Flash" by The Rolling Stones. It is the song for stage 26 of EBA.

### Waha

Waha is a chibi version of Yamato Suzuran from the visual novel, Suigetsu Mayoi Gokoro. The chibi Waha is a creation of 2channers. Waha is much loved both at 2chan and at 4chan for... actually we don't know why we like her, she's just lovable without a need of any explanation. There's a well known dancing Waha animated GIF that Nurse-kun apparently made into a flip book and gave to Amputee-chan for Valentines.

Nurse-kun does feel some apprehension when giving Amputan a picture of Waha, as she was developed from a character in an H-game. Hopefully, she'll never know.

### Katawa Shoujo

Around the same time that this story was concieved, a bunch of people from 4chan came together to make the first major English-language visual novel doujin: Katawa Shoujo. The cast is entirely made out of girls with disabilities, and became quite popular in the three years before it's first full release in 2012.

The visual novel is [available for free download](http://katawa-shoujo.com/) at their site.

[Leigh Alexander of Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/katawa-shoujo/) hints that 4chan's love of "Damaged Goods" (girls with disabilities) began not as another creepy fetish, but as a wave of empathy that anons felt after reading Nurse-kun's story.

## Fanart and other stuff

<s>(there was a lot of cool pictures that Anonymous drew, but the majority were lost when Wikichan went down. A few were saved by Shii and Encyclopedia Dramatica, but half of that was lost when Encyclopedia Dramatica itself was deleted.)</s>

All pictures have now been discovered in their original resolution from Sarafan's archive. They can be found in the addenum threads in the Chapters page.

## Thread Archives ##

These are direct html files of the original threads as they looked like on 4chan, as posted to Wikichan. All of these would have been lost due to Rapidshare's deletion policy, if not for a previously undiscovered upload that Sarafan made. We used these to add Anonymous's replies to Nurse-kun threads, as the ones on Wikichan and Shii's site only contained the story.

* [Everything, including fanart threads](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22186524/Wikichan-Damaged-Goods-Archive.7z)
