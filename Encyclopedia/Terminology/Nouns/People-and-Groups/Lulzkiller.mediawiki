Every now and then, we'll get the occasional fuck who lurks on /i/ and tries to ruin every raid by snitching on us. These fuckers are called '''lulzkillers''', and are more than a little annoying. Their motives are all different; sometimes, it may be just a failtroll looking for attention, while other times, it's [[Alex Wuori|some guy who's pissed at us because we won't raid this girl who rejected his fat ass]]. Either way, when one appears, deploy some Anons to start hunting for dox on the fucker, or else we can't fucking raid for shit.
