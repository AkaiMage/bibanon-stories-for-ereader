snow i haven't seen snow in many years ;_; if only i had the courage to look out the window ;_;
i never played in the snow ;_; my cousin once hid in a snow fort on the side of the road and was scooped up by a plow then deposited in a lakebed where he suffocated ;_;

well i was confused because i actually once threw a little snowball at a dog and i didnt realize it but the snowball was actually a big rock covered in snow ;_; the dog caught the "snowball" in its mouth and was hurt pretty badly ;_; the whole neighborhood was watching me do this too, because the dog had been catching and eating snowballs for like 10 minutes
i would post my family portrait on chansluts but my father is in the witness protection program

<J-kun> no amount of money can save me if I get sentenced to jail <age> maybe not but youll have like 35 dollars waiting for you on the outside

i once saw this guy go up to this box of bunnies on the side of the road ;_; he picked up the box then dumped the bunnies out and put the box in his car and drove away ;_; it was a pretty nice box though it was like an antique wine crate ;_;
<nd> when i was in high school no homo didnt exist <nd> you just had to never say gay things <age> when i was in high school, it was like i didnt exist ;_;
in high school people used to say no homo after everything they said. wednesdays used to be hotdog or hamburger day in the cafeteria and people used to actually say, "hot dog please, no homo"
the grim reality of my life will inevitably supercede any sort of fantasy i'll ever have ;_; this girl also forced me to caress her legs in the 10th grade for an extended amount of time ;_; she hadnt shaved them for several weeks and wanted me to feel how hairy they were
i remember on the first day of high school, i went home and rolled a die and I said that if it landed on 4, 5, or 6 i'd be destined to receive oral sex from this vietnamese girl i knew. and on the last day of high school she actually invited me to her house so i was pretty excited but when i went there she introduced me to her boyfriend and then this other guy hit him over the head with a hammer and her parents made me go home ;_;
she actually sent me an e-mail the next day and i thought she was going to ask me to come over again but she wanted help with homework ;_;
i had a friend in high school who was crippled and walked with a limp, the only thing that allowed him to carry on living was his faith in god and his devotion to his religion. one day he squeezed a packet of mayo into my hair in front of the whole class and i pretended not to be angry about it, but when he came to me crying because he couldnt find his st. patrick medallion, i didnt tell him that i'd found it earlier in the day and was keeping it in my shoe. i still have the medallion too and i've noticed that he's still crippled ;_; i wonder if they're at all related
in the 7th grade my art teacher thought that i was retarded and used to try to teach me how to ask people for things nicely. i guess i'm just grateful that someone took an interest in me
i recently put up an ad in the missed connections section where I listed and described every single girl that I'd seen that day. the only responses i received were from spam bots, but i replied to them anyway, knowing that there has to be a real person behind each of them
when i think about who i am and what i've become, i'm surprised that i don't hate myself more than i already do
am i the only person who thought the sopranos was about operettas
[2009-04-16|20:12.35] <@age> Sometimes I look at the sketches in my notebook and see nothing but the pitiful attempts of a miserable child to express to the world how he sees it.
[2009-09-27|18:52:53] <[heh]age> i had a music box shaped like an elephant that played the song... i didn't understand why it made me feel the way i did... but now I know that was my first face to face encounter with depression...
