'''Captain Picard''', played by British actor, Patrick Stewart, is a character from the hit television series ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''. 

Picard often shows up in [[4chan]] threads, most notably in the [[Headsigh#Facepalm|Facepalm]] macro showing him with his head bowed and a hand over his face. He is also featured in a macro showing him with an incredulous gesture and expression captioned by "WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?", and occasionally used to covertly refer to [[CP|child pornography]] (CP) in a non-controversial context.
