One day in the spring of 2005, someone came to [[/b/]] looking for help with their bloody nose. One of the first replies had '''IF THIS IS TRUE THEN HERE IS WHAT YOU DO''', in all caps, as the subject; the reply was sincere advice, a rarity on [[/b/]]. The rest of [[/b/]] thought this was hilarious, and a flood of [[shopped]] pictures and reposts featuring the phrase ensued. It was used as a stock response through out the summer and into the fall, and still shows up from time to time.
