**Puella Magi Madoka Magica** was the greatest and most influential anime of 2011. Masquerading as a stereotypical magical girl anime, it forces a darkly Faustian plot through the weak moral values of the genre. 

The magic of the narrative and the hidden secrets within turned otakus of trivial background into cryptographers, mathematicians, philosophers, and spectulating intellectuals within weeks.

The mark of a good story is its ability to enchant the viewer, to immerse the person  in its world, and to inspire intelligent discussion in its fanbase. Few other works have managed such a deconstruction anywhere near as elegantly. Almost none have done so on it's first try.
