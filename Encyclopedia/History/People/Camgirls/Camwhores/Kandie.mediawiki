== General ==

== History ==
* Began browsing [[4chan]] sometime between her Sophomore and Junior years of High School after being introduced to it by one of her ex-boyfriends and his group of friends.
* Lurked moar for a few months in /f/. Visited [[/b/]] a few times but fled in horror. 
* Posted a few times under the name of "mew" (don't remember the tripcode though) on a few of the boards, but mostly lurked.
* Became seriously involved in [[/b/]] sometime around February 2005. Saw the rise of Era and [[Cracky-chan]] and wished to be a camwhore, too.
* Posted herself several times, only to be faced with flaming /b/tards. Lurked more.
* Figured she'd try her hand at camwhoring again in January 2006 when she was sick for 3 weeks with the flu / mono / strept throat (the doctors don't know what it was). She decided to get herself a new name first. So using the name "kandie" from her Candy Kid raver days, she posted herself on January 5th with the text "being sick sucks...it's so boring". Popularity was gained.
* Reposted a few times after her threads died. On one occasion moot commented on one of her threads.
* Posted herself a few other times. Was unsuccessfully dubbed numerous -chan names. A few of them include Billboard-chan, Kike-chan, and Morman-chan.
* Saw the rise of numerous other chans to grace their presence on [[4chan]]. These include but are not limited to [[afro-chan]], [[Up-chan]], and [[Rabbit-chan]].
* Got bored with [[/b/]] after it degraded into the mess it is today and migrated to various cam websites. Eventually she received her own [[CHANCHAN]] board. Frequently goes on hiatus. Hangs out on skype and tinychat these days. Also frequent conventions, usually those found in Florida / the South Eastern United States. Possibly going to California for one in May.
