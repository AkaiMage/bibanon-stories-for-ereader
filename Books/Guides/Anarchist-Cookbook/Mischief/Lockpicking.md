## Lockpicking for the EXTREME beginner

Brought to you by: -= Exodus =-

This is really a good method for opening doors that are locked.  The
only problem with this, though, is that it only works for outward
opening doors.  Ok, here we go....

1.  Realize you are not working with the actual lock, but that thing
    that sticks between the door and the wall.
2.  See how that thing is curved on one side?  Well, that is what we
    will be making use of.
3.  Acquire a large paper-clip.  If it is too short, it won't work.
    You have to also have a shoelace.  Now, onto the construction...
4.  Straighten the paper-clip.
5.  Loop one end of the paper clip around the shoelace.  The shoelace
    should be about 4/5 on one side of the clip and 1/5 on the other.
    Let's see if I can draw it.

                          *******


       --- is the paper clip
       *** is the shoelace

     That's not very good, but I hope you get the picture.

6.  All you have to do now is curve the paper clip (no, I won't draw it)
7.  With the curved paper-clip, stick it between the door and the wall,
    behind the metal thing that sticks between. 
8.  Feed it through with you hand, until you can grip both sides of the
    shoelace.
9.  Now, simply pull the lace and the door at the same time, and VIOLA!
    the door is open.

I prefer this over regular lock-picking if the door opens outward, because
it is a lot quicker.  Lock picking can take 5 minutes... When done correctly
this only takes 30 seconds!  So, if you can, use this.

So you want to be a criminal.  Well, if you want to be like James 
Bond and open a lock in fifteen seconds, then go to Hollywood, 
because that is the only place you are ever going to do it.  Even 
experienced locksmiths can spend five to ten minutes on a lock if
they are unlucky.  If you are wanting extremely quick access, look
elsewhere.  The following instructions will pertain mostly to the
"lock in knob" type lock, since it is the easiest to pick.

First of all, you need a pick set.  If you know a locksmith, get 
him to make you a set.  This will be the best possible set for you
to use.  If you find a locksmith unwilling to supply a set, don't 
give up hope.  It is possible to make your own, if you have access
to a grinder (you can use a file, but it takes forever).

The thing you need is an allen wrench set (very small).  These 
should be small enough to fit into the keyhole slot.  Now, bend 
the long end of the allen wrench at a slight angle (not 90  
degrees).  Now, take your pick to a grinder or a file, and smooth 
the end until it is rounded so it won't hang inside the lock.  
Test your tool out on doorknobs at your house to see if it will 
slide in and out smoothly.  Now, this is where the screwdriver 
comes in.  It must be small enough for it and your pick to be used
in the same lock at the same time, one above the other.  In the 
coming instructions, please refer to this chart of the interior of
a lock:
    ______________________________
                                  \ K
            |  |  |  |   |   |    / E
               |     |   |   |    \ Y           [|]  Upper tumbler pin
            ^     ^               / H           [^]  Lower tumbler pin
            ^  ^  ^  ^   ^   ^    \ O           [-]  Cylinder wall
                                  / L   (This is a greatly simplified
                                  \ E    drawing)
    ______________________________/

The object is to press the pin up so that the space between the 
upper pin and the lower pin is level with the cylinder wall.  Now,
if you push a pin up, it's tendency is to fall back down, right?
That is where the screwdriver comes in.  Insert the screwdriver 
into the slot and turn.  This tension will keep the "solved" pins
from falling back down.  Now, work from the back of the lock to 
the front, and when you are through, there will be a click, the
screwdriver will turn freely, and the door will open.

Do not get discouraged on your first try!  It will probably take 
you about twenty to thirty minutes your first time.  After that,
you will quickly improve with practice.

## LOCKPICKING 3

If it becomes necessary to pick a lock to enter a lab, the world's most
effective lockpick is dynamite, followed by a sledgehammer.  There are
unfortunately, problems with noise and excess structural damage with these
methods. The next best thing, however, is a set of professional lockpicks.

These, unfortunately, are difficult to acquire. If the door to a lab is locked,
but the deadbolt is not engaged, then there are other possibilities. The rule
here is: if one can see the latch, one can open the door. There are several
devices which facilitate freeing the latch from its hole in the wall. Dental
tools, stiff wire ( 20 gauge ), specially bent aluminum from cans, thin
pocket knives, and credit cards are the tools of the trade. The way that all
these tools and devices are uses is similar: pull, push, or otherwise move the
latch out of its recess in the wall, thus allowing the door to open. This is
done by sliding whatever tool that you are using behind the latch, and forcing
the latch back into the door.

Most modern doorknob locks have two fingers. The larger finger holds the door
closed while the second (smaller) finger only prevents the first finger from
being pressed in when it (the second finger) is pressed in by the catchplate
of the door.  If you can separate the catch plate and the lock sufficiently
far, the second finger will slip out enough to permit the first finger to be
slipped.

       finger

Some methods for getting through locked doors are:

1. Another method of forced entry is to use an automobile jack to force the
   frame around the door out of shape, freeing the latch or exposing it to
   the above methods. This is possible because most door frames are designed
   with a slight amount of "give". Simply put the jack into position
   horizontally across the frame in the vicinity of the latch, and jack it
   out. If the frame is wood it may be possible to remove the jack after
   shutting the door, which will relock the door and leave few signs of
   forced entry. This technique will not work in concrete block buildings,
   and it's difficult to justify an auto jack to the security guards.
2. Use a screwdriver or two to pry the lock and door apart.  While holding
   them apart, try to slip the lock.  Screwdrivers, while not entirely
   innocent, are much more subtle than auto jacks, and much faster if they
   work.  If you're into unsubtle, I suppose a crowbar would work too, but
   then why bother to slip the lock at all?
3. Find a set of double doors.  They are particularly easy to pry apart far
   enough to slip.
4. If the lock is occasionally accessible to you while open, "adjust" or
   replace the catchplate to make it operate more suitably (i.e., work so
   that it lets *both* fingers out, so that it can always be slipped).  If
   you want, disassembling the lock and removing some of the pins can make
   it much easier to pick.
5. If, for some odd reason, the hinges are on your side (i.e., the door
   opens outward), remove the hinge pins (provided they aren't stopped with
   welded tabs).  Unfortunately, this too lacks subtlety, in spite of its
   effectiveness.
6. If the door cannot be slipped and you will want to get through regularly,
   break the mechanism.  Use of sufficient force to make the first finger
   retreat while the second finger is retreated will break some locks (e.g.,
   Best locks) in such a way that they may thereafter be slipped trivially,
   yet otherwise work in all normal ways.  Use of a hammer and/or
   screwdriver is recommended. Some care should be used not to damage the
   door jamb when attempting this on closed and locked doors, so as not to
   attract the attention of the users/owners/locksmith/police/....
7. Look around in desks.  People very often leave keys to sensitive things
   in them or other obvious places.  Especially keys to shared critical
   resources, like supply rooms, that are typically key-limited but that
   everyone needs access to.  Take measurements with a micrometer, or make a
   tracing (lay key under paper and scribble on top), or be dull and make a
   wax impression.  Get blanks for the key type (can be very difficult for
   better locks; I won't go into methods, other than to say that if you can
   get other keys made from the same blank, you can often work wonders with
   a little ingenuity) and use a file to reproduce the key.  Using a
   micrometer works best:  keys made from mic measurements are more likely
   to work consistently than keys made by any other method.  If you us
   tracings, it is likely to take many tries before you obtain a key that
   works reliably.  Also, if you can 'borrow' the cylinder and disassemble
   it, pin levels can be obtained and keys constructed.
8. Simple locks, like desks, can be picked fairly easily.  Many desks have
   simple three or four pin locks of only a few levels, and can be
   consistently picked by a patient person in a few minutes.  A small
   screwdriver and a paper clip will work wonders in practiced hands.  Apply
   a slight torque to the lock in the direction of opening with the
   screwdriver.  Then 'rake' the pins with the unfolded paper clip.  With
   practice, you'll apply enough pressure with the screwdriver that the pins
   will align properly (they'll catch on the cylinder somewhere between the
   top and bottom of their normal travel), and once they're all lined up,
   additional pressure on the screwdriver will then open the lock.  This, in
   conjunction with (7) can be very effective.  This works better with older
   or sloppily machined locks that have a fair amount of play in the
   cylinder.  Even older quality locks can be picked in this manner, if
   their cylinders have been worn enough to give enough play to allow pins
   to catch reliably. Even with a well worn quality lock, though, it
   generally takes a *lot* of patience.
9. Custodial services often open up everything in sight and then take
   breaks.  Make the most of your opportunities.
10. No matter what you're doing, look like you belong there.  Nothing makes
    anyone more suspicious than someone skulking about, obviously trying to
    look inconspicuous.  If there are several of you, have some innocuous and
    normal seeming warning method ("Hey, dummy!  What time is it?") so that
    they can get anything suspicious put away.  Don't travel in large groups
    at 3 AM.  Remember, more than one car thief has managed to enlist a cop's
    aid in breaking into a car.  Remember this.  Security people usually
    *like* to help people.  Don't make them suspicious or annoy them.  If you
    do run into security people, try to make sure that there won't be any
    theft or break-ins reported there the next day...
11. Consider the possibilities of master keys.  Often, every lock in a
    building or department will have a common master (building entrance keys
    are a common exception).  Take apart some locks from different places
    that should have common masters, measure the different pin lengths in
    each, and find lengths in common.  Experiment.  Then get into those
    places you're *really* curious about.
12. Control keys are fun, too.  These keys allow the user to remove the
    lock's core, and are generally masters.  (A pair of needle nose pliers or
    similar tool can then be used to open the lock, if desired.)

## SLIPPING A LOCK

The best material we've found for slips so far is soft sheet copper.  It
is quite flexible, so it can be worked into jambs easily, and can be pre-bent
as needed.  In the plane of the sheet, however, it is fairly strong, and pulls
nicely.  Of course, if they're flexible enough, credit cards, student IDs,
etc., work just fine on locks that have been made slippable if the door jamb
is wide enough.  Wonderfully subtle, quick, and delightfully effective.  Don't
leave home without one.

The sheet should then be folded to produce an L,J,or U shaped device that
looks like this:

We hasten to add here that many or most colleges and universities
have very strict policies about unauthorized possession of keys.  At
most, it is at least grounds for expulsion, even without filing criminal
charges.  Don't get caught with keys!!!  The homemade ones are
particularly obvious, as they don't have the usual stamps and marks
that the locksmiths put on to name and number the keys.]

we should also point out that if you make a nuisance of yourself, there are
various nasty things that can be done to catch you and/or slow you down.  For
instance, by putting special pin mechanisms in, locks can be made to trap any
key used to open them.  If you lose one this way, what can I say?  At least
don't leave fingerprints on it.  Or make sure they're someone else's.  Too
much mischief can also tempt the powers that be to rekey.

## OPENING COMBO LOCKS

[ Touched up by V.T - The Editor ]

First of all, let me tell you about the set-up of a lock.  When the lock
is locked, there is a curved piece of metal wedged inside the little notch on
the horseshoe shaped bar (known as the shackle) that is pushed in to the lock
when you lock it.

To free this wedge, you usually have to turn the lock to the desired
combination and the pressure on the wedge is released therefore letting the
lock open.  I will now tell you how to make a pick so you can open a lock
without having to waste all that time turning the combination (this also helps
when you don't know the combination to begin with).

To bypass this hassle, simply take a thinned hairpin (file it down) or
a opened out piece of a collapsing antenna (the inside diameter of the curved
piece of metal should be the same as the diameter of the shackle- if the metal
is too thick, use fine sandpaper to thin it down.

Once you have your hair pin (make sure it's metal), take the ridged side
and break it off right before it starts to make a U-turn onto the straight
side.  The curved part  can now be used as a handle. Now, using a file, file
down the other end until it is fairly thin.  You should do this to many
hairpins and file them so they are of different thicknesses so you can jimmy
various locks.

Look at a lock to see which side the lock opens from.  If you can't tell,
you will just have to try both sides.  When ya find out what side it opens
from, , take the lock pick and stick the filed end into the inside of the
horseshoe-shaped bar on whichever side the lock opens from.

Now, put pressure on the handle of the lock pick (pushing down, into the
crack) and pull the lock up and down.  The lock will then open because the
pick separated the wedge and the notch allowing it to open.

Also, this technique works best on American locks.  I have never picked a
Master lock before because of the shape a pressure of the wedge but if anyone
does it, let me know how long it took. Also, the Master lock casing is very
tight so ya can't get the shim in.

## Picking (old) Master Locks

_by The Jolly Roger_

Have you ever tried to impress someone by picking one of those 
Master combination locks and failed?

The Master lock company made their older combination locks with a 
protection scheme.  If you pull the handle too hard, the knob will 
not turn.  That was their biggest mistake.

### The first number:

Get out any of the Master locks so you know what is going on.  
While pulling on the clasp (part that springs open when you get 
the combination right), turn the knob to the left until it will 
not move any more, and add five to the number you reach.  You now 
have the first number of the combination.

### The second number:

Spin the dial around a couple of times, then go to the first 
number you got.  Turn the dial to the right, bypassing the first 
number once.  When you have bypassed the first number, start 
pulling on the clasp and turning the knob.  The knob will 
eventually fall into the groove and lock.  While in the groove, 
pull the clasp and turn the knob.  If the knob is loose, go to the 
next groove, if the knob is stiff, you have the second number of 
the combination.

### The third number:

After getting the second number, spin the dial, then enter the two 
numbers.  Slowly spin the dial to the right, and at each number, 
pull on the clasp.  The lock will eventually open if you did the 
process right.  

This method of opening Master locks only works on older models.  
Someone informed Master of their mistake, and they employed a new 
mechanism that is foolproof (for now).

The older models are from 1988-1990.  The newer models are being
cracked on as we speak..
