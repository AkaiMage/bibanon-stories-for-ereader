aka "[X] GENUFLECT". Will invariably turn up in any thread that has "choices" or "checkboxes" in the opening post. A [[meme]] from the parody/absurdist/MANLY short visual novel ''OMGWTFOTL''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://insani.org/omgwtfotl.html |title=omgwtfotl |publisher=insani.org |date=2006-04-09}}</ref>, in which nearly all choices have "Genuflect" as the final option. Ironically, choosing to genuflect always leads to the same bad end, though it's not like the other options are much better most of the time. Has pretty much replaced ''Excel Saga's'' "[[/a/#Put it in|Put it in]]" option.

Often when [[/a/]] says "genuflect" they refer not to the normal act of genuflection<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genuflection |title=Genuflection |publisher=Wikipedia}}</ref> where one goes down on one knee, but rather a double genuflection with bow - kind of like when facing Mecca.
