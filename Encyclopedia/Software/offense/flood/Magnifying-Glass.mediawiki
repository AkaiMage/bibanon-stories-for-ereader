'''Magnifying Glass''' is a UDP flooder specifically designed for Unix systems with the intention of being used to attack anontalk.se. It is substantially faster than other Unix flooders due to being written in C, and unlike hping it supports threading. It also supports a number of interesting features. However, it is not yet finished, but it is expected to be within the week (the client works, but some features are missing). It was written by some guy called phallus99 and can be downloaded [http://www.mediafire.com/?ehpzbsu3q32q52p here].
