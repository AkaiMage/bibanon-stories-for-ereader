Anime series about an 18-year-old (or so) young man named Kippei who has to take care of his abandoned young female cousin, Yuzuyu. There are several [[meme]]s from this show. The first shows Yuzuyu eating corn and saying [[I like corm]] (not to be confused with the actual vegetable called sometimes called a corm). The other is Yuzuyu holding up her fists with her cheeks puffed out. Yuzu in the act of slapping someone is also featured on a famous [[NIGGA PLEASE]] macro, her angry face making her look as if she's waving dismissively.

Perhaps due to her realistic personality, Yuzu inexplicably inspired strong protective tendencies on 4chan to the point suggestive humor about her (even on the old /lolicon/ board) was severely frowned upon.
