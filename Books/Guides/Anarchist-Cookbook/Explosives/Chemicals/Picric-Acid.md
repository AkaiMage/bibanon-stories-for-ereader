Picric acid, also known as Tri-Nitro-Phenol, or T.N.P., is a military
explosive that is most often used as a booster charge to set off another less
sensitive explosive, such as T.N.T.  It another explosive that is fairly
simple to make, assuming that one can acquire the concentrated sulfuric and
nitric acids.  Its procedure for manufacture is given in many college
chemistry lab manuals, and is easy to follow.  The main problem with picric
acid is its tendency to form dangerously sensitive and unstable picrate salts,
such as potassium picrate.  For this reason, it is usually made into a safer
form, such as ammonium picrate, also called explosive D.  A social deviant
would probably use a formula similar to the one presented here to make picric
acid.

     ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ                         ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
     phenol (9.5 g)                    500 ml flask

     concentrated                      adjustable heat source
     sulfuric acid  (12.5 ml)
                                       1000 ml beaker
     concentrated nitric               or other container
     acid (38 ml)                      suitable for boiling in

     distilled water                   filter paper
                                       and funnel

                                       glass stirring rod

1. Place 9.5 grams of phenol into the 500 ml flask, and carefully add 12.5 ml
   of concentrated sulfuric acid and stir the mixture.
2. Put 400 ml of tap water into the 1000 ml beaker or boiling container and
   bring the water to a gentle boil.
3. After warming the 500 ml flask under hot tap water, place it in the boiling
   water, and continue to stir the mixture of phenol and acid for about thirty
   minutes.  After thirty minutes, take the flask out, and allow it to cool
   for about five minutes.
4. Pour out the boiling water used above, and after allowing the container to
   cool, use it to create an ice bath, similar to the one used in section
   3.13, steps 3-4.  Place the 500 ml flask with the mixed acid an phenol in
   the ice bath.  Add 38 ml of concentrated nitric acid in small amounts,
   stirring the mixture constantly.  A vigorous but "harmless" reaction should
   occur.  When the mixture stops reacting vigorously, take the flask out of
   the ice bath.
5. Warm the ice bath container, if it is glass, and then begin boiling more
   tap water.  Place the flask containing the mixture in the boiling water,
   and heat it in the boiling water for 1.5 to 2 hours.
6. Add 100 ml of cold distilled water to the solution, and chill it in an ice 
   bath until it is cold.
7. Filter out the yellowish-white picric acid crystals by pouring the solution 
   through the filter paper in the funnel.  Collect the liquid and dispose of 
   it in a safe place, since it is corrosive.
8. Wash out the 500 ml flask with distilled water, and put the contents of the 
   filter paper in the flask.  Add 300 ml of water, and shake vigorously.
9. Re-filter the crystals, and allow them to dry.
10. Store the crystals in a safe place in a glass container, since they will
    react with metal containers to produce picrates that could explode
    spontaneously.

## Making Picric Acid from Asprin

Picric Acid can be used as a booster explosive in detonators, a high 
explosive charge, or as an intermediate to preparing lead picrate.

### Material Required

* Aspirin tablets (5 grains per tablet)
* Alcohol, 95% pure
* Sulfuric acid, concentrated, (if battery acid, boil until white fumes disappear)
* Potassium Nitrate (see elsewhere in this Cookbook)
* Water
* Paper towels
* Canning jar, 1 pint
* Rod (glass or wood)
* Glass containers
* Ceramic or glass dish
* Cup
* Teaspoon
* Tablespoon
* Pan
* Heat source
* Tape

### Procedure

1. Crush 20 aspirin tablets in a glass container. Add 1 teaspoon of water 
and work into a paste.
2. Add approximately 1/3 to 1/2 cup of alcohol (100 millilitres) to the 
aspirin paste; stir while pouring.
3. Filter the alcohol-aspirin solution through a paper towel into another 
glass container. Discard the solid left in the paper towel.
4. Pour the filtered solution into a glass or ceramic dish.
5. Evaporate the alcohol and water from the solution by placing the dish 
into a pan of hot water. White powder will remain in the dish after 
evaporation.
  * **NOTE**: The water in the pan should be at hot bath temperature, not boiling, 
approx. 160 to 180 degress farenheit. It should not burn the hands.
6. Pour 1/3 cup (80 millilitres) of concentrated sulfuric acid into a 
canning jar. Add the white powder to the sulfuric acid.
7. Heat canning jar of sulfuric acid in a pan of simmering hot water bath 
for 15 minutes; then remove jar from the bath. Solution will turn to a 
yellow-orange color.
8. Add 3 level teaspoons (15 grams) of potassium nitrate in three portions 
to the yellow-orange solution; stir vigorously during additions. Solution 
will turn red, then back to a yellow-orange color.
9. Allow the solution to cool to ambient room temperature while stirring 
occasionally.
10. Slowly pour the solution, while stirring, into 1-1/4 cup (300 
millilitres) of cold water and allow to cool.
11. Filter the solution through a paper towel into a glass container. Light 
yellow particles will collect on the paper towel.
12. Wash the light yellow particles with 2 tablespoons (25 millilitres) of 
water. Discard the waste liquid in the container.
13. Place articles in ceramic dish and set in a hot water bath, as in step 
5, for 2 hours.
