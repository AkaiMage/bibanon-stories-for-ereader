[[Image:Gaston WTF.jpg|thumb]]
== Meme ==
A meme based off of the antagonist from Disney's animated film, The Beauty and the Beast. It began in [[/b/]] with images posted of a scene from the film wherein Belle is speaking to Gaston, and Gaston is looking sideways at a book that Belle was carrying. The humor of this image was enough to give Gaston footing as a meme, as shops of his face swapped with Belle's and others soon arose. Also, posts arose stating things like "NO ONE * LIKE GASTON," based off of lines from a song that shares Gaston's name, that shows high praise for him.

Because Gaston achieved memehood shortly before the inception of the [[DESU|DESU meme]], he was often shown in images to be fighting, killing, or otherwise menacing characters from Rozen Maiden, posted by users annoyed by the frequency of threads spamming the DESU meme.
