I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for anti-furries in the history of our *chan.

At least 100 years ago, /b/tards, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, said "Fuck Moot" and made 7chan, 12chan and 420chan. This momentous decision came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Nigras who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.

But one hundred years later, the Nigra still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Nigra is still sadly crippled by the manacles of furries and the chains of idiocy. One hundred years later, the Nigra lives in a island of sanitry in the midst of a vast ocean of furfaggotry and AIDs. One hundred years later, the Nigra is still languishing in the corners of *chan society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense we have come to our /b/ to kill furries. When the architects of our *chans wrote the magnificent words of the Rules of the Internet, they were signing a promissory note to which every anonymous was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all anon would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and most importantly, the right to Fursecute.

It is obvious today that *chans have defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her Nigras are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, the chans have given the Nigra people some justice, justice which has destroyed the furries home. But we refuse to believe that this alone will rid us of the furry menace. We refuse to believe that these are welcomed here, in our home, at 7chan. So I have come with a proposal â€” a proposal that will rid us of furries and indirectly, AIDs. I have also come to this hallowed spot to remind channers of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises to the Internet Hate Machine. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of furfaggotry to the sunlit path of purity as a race. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of furfags to the solid rock of /b/rotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of Raptor Jesus' children.

It would be fatal for the chans to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Nigrs's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and an end to furries. Two Thousand Seven is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Nigras needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if /b/ returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in any chan until the Nigra is granted his birthright. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our /b/ until the bright day of justice emerges.

But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not care if we are guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us feel free about satisfying our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of epic win and raids.

We must forever conduct our struggle on the plane of crapflooding and lulz. We must not allow our win to degenerate into fail. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting furfaggotry with b&'s. The marvelous militancy which the Nigra community has always stood for, must lead us to distrust of all furries, for many of the furries, as proved time and time again, are gay. Anonymous walks alone.

As we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the Furry Hating Anons, "When will you be satisfied?" We can never be satisfied as long as the Nigra is the victim of the fucking stupidity of furries. We can never be satisfied, as long as our memes, cannot gain lodging in their homeland. We can never be satisfied as long as a Nigra in any *chan (excluding fchan) has to deal with furfaggot bullshit. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.

I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from 4chan. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for the end of furfaggotry left you frustrated, without any means to bring about your righteous goal. You have been the veterans of both fail and win. Continue to work with the faith that Furries will indeed YIFF IN HELL.

Go back to /b/, go back to /i/, knowing that we can stop these fucking furries from staying in our /b/, our /i/, our home in the tubez.

I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the *chan dream.

I have a dream that one day this /b/ will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "Anonymous does not forgive."

I have a dream that one day on the meme filled hills of /b/ the sons of /b/tards will be able to sit down at their computers and go onto /b/ without hearing any furfaggotry.

I have a dream that one day even fchan, a chan made for the furries, will be killed with fire.

I have a dream that all /b/tards will one day live in a *chan where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, their nationality or their intelligence. But simply by if they are a furry or not.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day, down in /b/, with its trolls, with its mods having their dicks dripping with the spit of 9000 lolis; one day right there in /b/, pedos and little girls will be able to fuck. Full force in the mouth, vagina and ass.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day every meme shall be exalted, every furry shall be made dead, the femnazis will be fucked at full force, and the lulz will be plentiful, and the glory of Raptor Jesus shall be revealed, and all anons shall see it together.

This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to IRL with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our *chan into a beautiful symphony of /b/rotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to get v& together, to stand up for lulz together, knowing that we will be free one day.

This will be the day when all of Raptor Jesus' children will be able to post with a new meaning, "This is 7chan, it is made of anti-furry and win."

And if 7chan is to be the greatest *chan this must become true. So let anti-furrydom ring from the prodigious hilltops of 2ch. Let anti-furrydom ring from the mighty mountains of 420chan. Let anti-furrydom ring from the tops of 12chan!

Let anti-furrydom ring from 4chan!

Let anti-furrydom ring from [fa]pchan!

But not only that; let anti-furrydom ring from all chans! From every chan, let anti-furrydom ring.

And when this happens, When we allow freedom to win, when we win from every thread and every post, from every board and every chan, we will be able to speed up that day when all of Raptor Jesus' children, Anonymous, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Nigra spiritual, "Someone screencap this!"

tl;dr: YIFF IN HELL
