##OP
We just started dating, but I’m really surprised by the differences in how men and women think.
I need to know the secrets of good dating… (´･ω･`)
Like where to have good dates…

###2ch
Why, you… Are you the Denko guy?

##OP
Ah, uh, yes, you were all very helpful with Denko. (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Oh, it’s A-ko now, right…
The master-slave relationship.

###2ch
Did you give up on Denko or what?

##OP
I wrote a letter and gave it to her! (´･ω･`)

###2ch
At any rate, you need to be close with your partner.

##OP
Hm… Is that the trick to a long relationship?

###2ch
What happened next, OP?

###2ch
How’s it going with A-ko?
Well?

##OP
A lot of stuff happened at the hotel, and we had sex… (´･ω･`)
Though we had a serious dispute after…

###2ch
First, tell us what’s not going well, and list what you don’t understand.

##OP
Men and women just seem to think so differently… (´･ω･`)
So there’s a lot of stuff I’m worried about.
Like if a guy has unprotected sex, does that mean he thinks of women as being solely for pleasure?
Which would make a girl really mad…
Because yeah, she got really mad at me… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
How much did you pay to sex A-ko?

##OP
She said she’d do it if I bought her 500,000 yen in clothes, but that’s a lot of money, so I negotiated it down to 350,000… (´･ω･`)
It was a really great experience, better than I could’ve imagined… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Christ, where the hell are you getting your money?

##OP
My family is pretty rich, and I know where they hide the money… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
How much have you paid A-ko in total?

##OP
I don’t know… Probably more than 700,000 yen?

###2ch
What, ONLY 700,000 yen?
A regular couple going from first dates to intercourse takes at least 2 million!

Love A-ko more, dammit!

###2ch
Wait, you “know where they hide the money”? You’re stealing money from your parents?

I’m… curious, to say the least.

###2ch
Unprotected sex, jfc… How irresponsible are you?
If you get together, how the hell are you going to raise a kid?
I feel beyond bad for any kid with a parent like you…

##OP
A-ko said the same thing… I guess that’s how girls think… (´･ω･`)
Well, I’ve learned from it now.
But girls like it that way in H manga and porn videos, right?
I thought unprotected was supposed to be better…

###2ch
This is quite a direction things are going in…

###2ch
You need to learn that sexy books are different from real life!
Did you at least give a good apology?

##OP
I’m not really sure why I’d need to apologize, since I was crying with her too…
The third dimension is hard… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Just get a prostitute, man! 350,000 yen, hot damn…

##OP
There’s no love with prostitutes, so I don’t wanna… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
What’s OP’s idea of a “girlfriend”? What does it mean to you?

##OP
An embodiment of love? I dunno, you’re embarrassing me… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
You’re right, the third dimension is hard.
But intercourse is a holy act that gives way to new life, too.
You’ve learned you can’t be careless, right, OP?
If you make a single misstep, A-ko will just think you’re incredibly irresponsible.
So be more careful with her, okay?

##OP
Huh? But if she has a baby, will we be able to raise it together?
I’m not irresponsible enough to abandon a baby… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Men who can’t cook ain’t suited for marriage, dude!

##OP
I CAN MAKE SPAGHETTI (´･ω･`)

###2ch
A-ko is your girlfriend. You should want to see your kid in the future.
It was just a bad time for it.
When you both want it, then have all the unprotected sex you want.

###2ch
I know how you feel. When you fall in love, everything seems to run right by you.
But does A-ko want children right now?
If she doesn’t, then of course she’ll get mad.
But if you both really want kids, then it’s not too late.
And more importantly, consider the kid’s happiness too.

##OP
That’s a novel thought! I just sent that to A-ko!

###2ch
You had sex with A-ko? And she was a virgin?

##OP
She said it was her first time… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Reading through all this, I’ve been interested in OP himself.
What kind of environment did your family raise you in?
If we know that, we might know OP’s personality better to give him better advice.

##OP
I think it’s a pretty ordinary family…
I guess my mom was extra nice to me… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
What did you write in that letter to Denko?
Wasn’t dating A-ko supposed to be a secret?

And if A-ko said she wanted to be a virgin until marriage, was she really planning to marry OP?

###2ch
Once Denko learns this situation with A-ko, she’s gonna be jealous for sure.
Since he put out 700,000 yen for her.
Then her love for him will truly come out.

##OP
I talked with Denko in private about dating A-ko.
I’m still a little in love with Denko, like I thought I might be…
I might be happy in a way if she got jealous… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
If you spent 350,000 of the 700,000 for sexytimes, what was the rest for?

##OP
Buying information, mostly… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Make sure to keep enough around for pregnancy, birth, and child-raising.

##OP
Well, I’ll do my best. (´･ω･`)

###2ch
So OP has rich parents, huh.
And his mother was nice, but what about his father?
Also, his brother said he didn’t want to get involved with him. How’d it come to that? Did something happen?

##OP
We had a fight a long time ago, and I guess he’s still mad about it… (´･ω･`)
My dad was usually at work, so I don’t have much of an image of him. (´･ω･`)

###2ch
What was the fight about?

##OP
I don’t really want to say… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
OP sure is something.
If possible, can you tell us how things went to get to the sex?
I want it for reference.

##OP
I guess the trick is appealing to how much you think about the girl…? (´･ω･`)

###2ch
Huh?? You said you sent her an email, but didn’t she forbid OP sending her emails??

##OP
Well, she hasn’t replied in four days, so I was getting really worried… (´･ω･`)

###2ch
What happened to the bullying at school?

##OP
I’m not going to school! I’m probably not going back for another month…

###2ch
You should go to school!
I’m sure A-ko wants to see you at school, too!

She’s been too timid to email you for four days.

You have to consider that A-ko wants to be with you more, OP!

##OP
So sleepy… (´･ω･`)

I don’t have the courage to go to school…

###2ch
What’s up with A-ko now?

##OP
I don’t know… I don’t get how girls think at all…

###2ch
A-ko’s a good girl.
Giving her virginity to OP…

###2ch
Except I really doubt she’s a virgin…

###2ch
Maybe he fell asleep?

Looking forward to the next conversation.

###2ch
I guess… I’ll sleep too.

###2ch
Looking forward to the next thread.



And then…

…and then, nothing.

The OP didn’t post again. The thread died. And unless people just stopped keeping a lookout for threads titled “[Help!] ___ (´･ω･`)”, nothing more was posted. We never know what happened to the perhaps-no-longer-stalked Denko, the apparently-pregnant A-ko, or… the OP.

The first thread was started on April 6th, 2011, and the last post from the OP was on May 2nd, 2011. However, the threads only came to my attention recently, perhaps because it had been nearly a year since people last heard about them.

I think the comment near the end of the second thread says it pretty well. Even if the OP was a troll, it’s scary that he could even make these things up. It’s scary because - as some of us know firsthand - people like him do exist, even if they aren’t all obvious about it online.

Whether or not the OP was real only determines whether or not Denko was a real girl suffering from real stalking. There still can be and still have been countless others whom this really, definitely happens to.

At any rate, this is the way the story ends. Not with a shank, but with a

(´･ω･`)
