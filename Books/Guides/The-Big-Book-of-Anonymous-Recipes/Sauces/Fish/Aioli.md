## Ingredients ##

* 1 litre olive oil
* 10 garlic cloves
* 3 egg yolks
* salt, pepper

## Making it ##

* open one bulb, take the good cloves, and leave all the dried or blemishes away
* peel them, cut them in two and remove the central germ
* roughly crush them in a mortar
* use the pestel to finely crush them
  * incorporate a bit of salt and grind until you obtain a smooth paste
* without stopping the pestle, start adding the egg yolks and oil
  * keep the movement regular and steady, or it will not give a good emulsion
  * you may add a sip of lemon juice and hot water if you want
* keeping the move, slowly add sips of oil, being careful the emulsion does not collapse
* when the mix starts becoming thicker and peeling off the mortar's edges, you can start adding oil in greater quantities
* the finished product should be shiny, ripe with oil, and solid enough that the pestle holds straight in it without moving
