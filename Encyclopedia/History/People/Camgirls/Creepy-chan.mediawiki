[[Creepy-chan]], also known as '''Cute-chan''', '''Tussin-chan''' and '''Alli''', is a non-self-posting camgirl. She first appeared on [[/b/]] in late 2005 under the name Tussin-chan, a reference to her tripped-out appearance. She was later renamed Creepy-chan when more pictures of her were posted and it became apparant that her distinctive appearance was mostly caused by a predilection towards heavy eye makeup and her signature wide-eyed stare.

== General ==
* Name: Allison Harvard
* Alias: Creepy-chan, Cute-chan, Tussin-chan
* DOB: 1989
* Location: New Orleans, Louisiana

== History ==
Creepy faded into obscurity in early 2006 until [[Anonymous]] found her [[MySpace]] and the wealth of pictures it contained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/elisabeta |title=alli |publisher=MySpace}}</ref> It became apparent that Creepy-chan was not always or could not always be creepy, so her dual personality was born - Cute-chan. Cute-chan does not wear heavy eye makeup or wear pink dresses and stand on coffee tables; rather, she wears normal clothes and goes about her everyday business in a decidedly cute fashion.

Several [[/b/]]tards claim to know Creepy-chan personally, but this is most likely false. One early picture of Creepy-chan has surfaced, however, leading some to believe that she may have /b/tard friends she doesn't know about.
