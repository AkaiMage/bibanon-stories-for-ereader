# Overview #

A simple Windows based mail bomber works with any gmail account (can bomb any email). It is a simple .exe so nothing is required except a windows based computer. It can flood up to an e-mail a second to multiple e-mail addresses. To use just create an account on gmail (use a proxy) enter the info and spam away to your hearts desire. I also just figured out that you can launch several instances of the program at a time using the same e-mail log in. I have managed to launch up to twelve instances which is a whopping 12 emails a second.
