'''Good Naruto, you look kind of cool''' is about an image of Sakura commenting on Naruto from the anime of the same name. In the image, Naruto's eyes are looking in opposite directions. The image is from a scene in the Chuunin exam when the Naruto team is battling Orochimaru in the forest. Orochimaru's tongue is featured in an additional edit of the image, by the author of the original.

The image showed up in [[/a/]] on 2005/01/11 with the aforementioned fansubbed line. The original fansub by ANBU-AonE contained this exact line and it is a correct translation.
