According to white supremacist radio host [[Hal Turner]], in December 2006 and January 2007 individuals who identified themselves as Anonymous took Turner's website offline, costing him thousands of dollars in [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] bills. As a result, Turner sued [[4chan]], [[eBaum's World]], 7chan, and other websites for [[copyright infringement]]. He lost his plea for an injunction, however, and failed to receive letters from the court, which caused the lawsuit to lapse.<ref name="halsuecopyright">{{cite web |url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-njdce/case_no-2:2007cv00306/case_id-198438/ |publisher=Justia |title=Harold C.

In July 2010, this was a reaction to the use of one of Anonymous' slogans by the [[Oregon Tea Party]]. The Party's Facebook page was flooded with [[image macro]] and flames. Within a few hours, the Tea Party posted a message saying "Anonymous: We appreciate your resources and admire your tactics. You have taught us more than you know.

On April 2, 2011 Anonymous launched an attack on the media giant Sony, named #opsony, as a part of Operation Payback.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dunn |first=John E |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/224360/anonymous_launches_attack_against_sony_ps3_websites.html |title=Anonymous Launches Attack Against Sony PS3 Websites |publisher=PCWorld |date=2011-04-05 |accessdate=2011-08-30}}</ref> Anonymous claims the attack a success after they took down the PlayStation Network and other related PlayStation Websites. Anonymous' actions also included personal harassment of employees and their families. The PlayStation Network subsequently has had lengthy outages, although Anonymous claims that this is not due to any officially-sanctioned action on their part, but may be due to sub-groups of Anonymous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/04/anonymous-goes-after-sony-makes-it-personal-very-personal.ars|title=Anonymous goes after Sony, makes it personal... very personal|author=Nate Anderson|publisher=ars technica}}</ref>

Sony Corp. came to Anonymous' attention after it took legal action against George Hotz (a.k.a. GeoHot), the coder behind a popular tool that allows homebrew software to run on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). In addition, Sony is also taking legal action against Alexander Egorenkov (a.ka. Graf_Chokolo) for his efforts to restore Linux to the PS3.
The reason why Hotz and Egorenkov did that follows on from Sony's decision to remove the system's OtherOS feature, which enabled the use of Linux. While the pair has earned respect for their research and technical skills, they have also gained the attention of Sony's legal team.
With a lawsuit now against Hotz this attracted the attention of Anonymous. They claim that Sony is breaching the free speech border, and this is the reason for their actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201114/7017/Anonymous-Operation-Sony-is-a-double-edged-sword|title=Anonymous' Operation: Sony is a double-edged sword|author=Steve Ragan|publisher=Tech Herald}}</ref>

In August 2011, in response to [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]]'s shutdown of cell phone service in an attempt to disconnect protesters from assembling non-violently in response to a police shooting, Anonymous sent out a mass email/fax bomb to BART personnel and organized multiple mass physical protests at the network's Civic Center station.<ref>{{cite web|last=Poeter |first=Damon |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2391160,00.asp |title=Anonymous BART Protest Shuts Down Several Underground Stations &#124; News & Opinion |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2011-08-15 |accessdate=2011-08-30}}</ref>

===Support of Occupy Wall Street===
Several contingents of Anonymous have given support to the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement, with members attending local protests and blogs run by members covering [[Occupy movement|the movement]].<ref>http://anonnews.org/?p=press&a=item&i=1185</ref><ref>http://anonops.blogspot.com/</ref> <ref>http://anonywebz.com/</ref>

===Operation Syria===
In early August, Anonymous hacked the [[Syria]]n [[Ministry of Defense (Syria)|Defense Ministry]] website and replaced it with a [[vector graphics|vector image]] of the pre-[[Ba'ath Party|Ba'athist]] flag, a symbol of the pro-democracy movement in the country, as well as a message supporting the [[2011 Syrian uprising]] and calling on members of the [[Syrian Army]] to defect to protect protesters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/08/08/139094501/syria-is-hacked-by-anonymous-and-pressed-by-gulf-allies|agency=National Public Radio|date=8 August 2011|accessdate=8 August 2011|title=Syria Is Hacked By Anonymous, And Pressed By Gulf Allies|first=Bill|last=Chappell}}</ref>

In September, a group tied to Anonymous appeared on Twitter, calling themselves RevolluSec,<ref>https://twitter.com/#revolusec</ref> short for Revolution Security. They made their mission statement clear with a press release<ref>http://pastebin.com/1i7VR93E</ref> posted on [[Pastebin]]. They defaced many Syrian websites, including the site of every major city in Syria<ref>http://youranonnews.tumblr.com/post/10622268842/every-major-city-in-syria-defaced</ref> To view the defaces after they were taken down, [[Telecomix]] mirrored them.<ref>https://telecomix.ceops.eu/material/deface-20110925/</ref> RevoluSec also defaced The Syrian Central Bank<ref>http://twitpic.com/6snr99/full</ref> As well as a number of pro-regime sites<ref>http://youranonnews.tumblr.com/post/10666372975/12-webpages-pwnt-by-syrinyan/,</ref> replacing them with a warped imaged of [[Bashar al-Assad]], accompanied by [[Nyan Cat]].

[[Telecomix]] worked with Anonymous throughout the ongoing operation, Telecomix showing Syrians how to bypass the censorship, and Anonymous hacking the regime any way they can online. Both groups maintain [[IRC]] channels dedicated to this operation.

===Operation DarkNet===
In October 2011, the collective campaigned against child pornography protected by [[anonymity network| anonymous hosting techniques]].<ref>http://pastebin.com/T1LHnzEW</ref> They took down 40 child porn sites, published the names of over 1500 people frequenting those websites,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/mobiledia/2011/10/25/hackers-attack-child-porn-sites/ | work=Forbes}}</ref> and invited the [[FBI]] and [[Interpol]] to follow up.<ref>http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/235991/20111023/anonymous-hacking-group-targets-child-porn-web-sites-releases-user-names-lolita-city-child-pornograp.htm</ref>

===Opposition to Los Zetas===
On October 6, 2011, Anonymous released a video stating that [[Los Zetas]] had kidnapped one of the group's members, and threatened that unless the hostage was freed, they would publish personal information about members of the cartel and their collaborators in politics, police, military, and business, which might lead to their prosecution by Mexican authorities, or targeting by rival cartels.  The website of Gustavo Rosario Torres, a former Tabasco state prosecutor, was subsequently defaced with a message suggesting his involvement with the organization.<ref>

===Operation Brotherhood Takedown===
On November 7th, Anonymous released a warning threat to the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] that they would take down major websites belonging to their organization.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnPTBLbazAo</ref> The Muslim Brotherhood posted an article on their website explaining the dilemma.<ref>www.ikhwanonline.com</ref> The following Friday some websites belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood were down for about 6 hours. Another video was released claiming the attack would continue till November 18th.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBe9co3l9wI</ref>

===Operation Blackout===
In response to the increased recognition of the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] bill, Anonymous decided to take drastic action. It called for Emergency Action from the people as well as mass protests and spreading the word, in a video<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czY-dZQsd-k</ref> they released on November 18th. This operation is currently still ongoing.  The latest activity occurred on Wednesday, January 18, 2012, where Anonymous, having previously called for a blackout from 8a-8p Eastern time, convinced Google Inc. and Wikipedia itself (albeit indirectly) to participate.  Wikipedia was blacked out for 24 hours, Google shut down every service but the search engine, while blacking out their own name, and other sites participated in less-extreme ways, e.g. TV Tropes posted a black banner at the top of every page that said "Stop SOPA!" repeatedly.

===Operation Mayhem===
On November 18, Anonymous released a video claiming to have released the [[Guy Fawkes Virus]] on Facebook and would release it on Twitter. This virus had a number of different reasons for being released; the violence of the police force in [[Occupy Wall Street]], the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and against anyone who claims to be against [[Anonymous (Group)|Anonymous]].{{fact|date=January 2012}}

===Attack on Lt. John Pike===
Anonymous released a video with the entirety of Lt. John Pike's contact information following the incident at Occupy UC Davis, in which the lieutenant pepper sprayed a group of nonviolent student protesters. YouTube has taken the video down, but not quickly enough before people could flood his phone, Skype, email, and mailbox with messages. An investigation into the event is ongoing.

===Attack on Stratfor===
On December 24th, claims were made that Anonymous stole thousands of e-mail addresses and credit card information from security firm [[Stratfor]]. Reportedly, Anonymous commented that this is because the data was unencrypted, however Anonymous put out a press-release stating "This hack is most definitely not the work of Anonymous".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16330396|title='Anonymous' hackers hit US security firm Stratfor|author=BBC News|date=2011-12-26|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

===Occupy Nigeria===
In solidarity with [[Occupy Nigeria]], Anonymous has joined forces with the [[People's Liberation Front (group) |People's Liberation Front]] and the Naija Cyber Hactivists of Nigeria. Anonymous promised “a relentless and devastating assault upon the web assets of the Nigerian government” in support of Occupy Nigeria. 
This was in protest to the removal of  fuel subsidy that the majority of impoverished Nigerians depend upon for their very existence. As a consequence of the action the price of fuel and transportation has skyrocketed, causing extreme hardship upon the majority of Nigerians. On January 13, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission website was hacked, with a false report of the arrest of people involved in the oil sector replacing the normal page.<ref>http://pmnewsnigeria.com/2012/01/13/subsidy-protest-efcc-site-hacked-with-false-arrests-oil-moguls/</ref>

===Operation Megaupload===
{{Wikinews|US government, music industry websites taken offline in web attack}} 
In retaliation for the shut down of the file sharing service [[Megaupload]] and the arrest of four workers,<ref>http://www.3news.co.nz/Technology/Story/tabid/412/ctl/EditArticle/mid/3187/articleID/240007/Default.aspx?AMRetUrl=L0RlZmF1bHQuYXNweD9UYWJJZD00MTImYXJ0aWNsZUlEPTI0MDAwNw%3d%3d</ref> Anonymous [[DDoS |DDoSed]] the websites of [[Universal Music Group|UMG]] (the company responsible for the lawsuit against Megaupload), the [[United States Department of Justice]], the [[United_States_Copyright_Office|United States Copyright Office]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[MPAA]], [[Warner Brothers Music]] and the [[RIAA]], as well as the [[HADOPI]] the afternoon of January 19, 2012. <ref>http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/01/19/anonymous-hackers-claims-attack-on-doj-universal-music-and-riaa-after-megaupload-takedown/</ref>
The operations by Anonymous are most likely driven further by anger over the House of Representatives' Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Senate's Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA). <ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16646023</ref>

===The Polish Revolution and other anti-ACTA activism in Europe===
On January 21st a series of [[DDoS]] attacks on Polish government websites took place, for which the Anonymous took responsibility and referred to as "the Polish Revolution"<ref>http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/83910,Anonymous-shuts-down-Polish-PMs-web-site</ref>. The group via their Twitter account stated it was a revenge for upcoming signing of [[ACTA]] agreement by the Polish government. Starting with sejm.gov.pl, websites of the Polish Prime Minister, President, Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, later on the police, Internal Security Agency (Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego) Ministry of Foreign Affairs were also blocked. The presumed attack was further strengthen by the media coverage which resulted in extremely high interest of public opinion, followed up by blackout of popular polish websites on 24th<ref>http://antyweb.pl/juz-ponad-800-serwisow-uczestniczy-w-dzisiejszym-protescie-przeciwko-acta-liczba-ta-szybko-rosnie/</ref> and protests of thousands of people on 24th and 25th of January, in major cities of Poland<ref>http://warszawa.naszemiasto.pl/artykul/galeria/1251837,protest-przeciw-acta-w-warszawie-w-manifestacji-bralo,id,t.html#</ref>, against signing ACTA. Other suspected targets were the websites of [[Paweł Graś]] - the government's spokesman (blocked after Graś denied the attacks ever took place), the website of [[PSL]] (blocked after [[Eugeniusz Kłopotek]], a member of the party, supported ACTA on air of the major tv station).
Governmental sites in France's presidential website<ref>http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hA6W7Gu6gTAHz8KvIZTluNTh8b5Q?docId=CNG.6c59117697b540dd3fa7f0314f6ff7b4.d1</ref> and Austria's Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Economy and also the website of the Federal Chancellor <ref>http://news.am/eng/news/90443.html</ref> were also cracked and paralysed.
