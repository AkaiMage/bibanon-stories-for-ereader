Futaba Channel (or confusingly, 2chan) is Japan's most popular [[Imageboard]]. Users with IP addresses that can't be traced back to Japan cannot post.

### Origin ###

Futaba was designed to be the 4th main site of [[Nanashi World]] in case the current one, [[2ch]], broke down. The community has since diverged greatly from it's predecessor.

Futaba Channel was extremely popular on [[Something Awful]]'s [[ADTRW]] boards, as it's anonymous image posting system was important in an era before image hosting. The site inspired [[moot]] to create [[4chan]], and it's code, [[Futalullaby]], formed the basis of 4chan's Yotsuba codebase (though by now it has been heavily rewritten).

### Raids

Futaba is home to epic raids that you can't participate in.
