Sodium Chlorate is similar to potassium chlorate,and in most cases can be a
substitute.  Sodium chlorate is also more soluble in water.  You can find
sodium chlorate at Channel or any hardware/home improvement store.  It is used
in blowtorches and you can get about 3lbs for about $6.00.

    2 wires, 16 gauge (3/64 in. diameter approx.), 6 ft. long, insulated.
    Gasoline
    1 gallon glass jar, wide mouth (5 in. diameter by 6 in. high approx.)

## Procedure

1. Mix 1/2 cup of salt into the one gallon glass jar with 3 litres (3 
quarts) of water.
2. Add 2 teaspoons of battery acid to the solution and stir vigorously 
for 5 minutes.
3. Strip about 4 inches of insulation from both ends of the two wires.
4. With knife and sticks, shape 2 strips of wood 1 by 1/8 by 1-1/2. Tie 
the wood strips to the lead or carbon rods so that they are 1-1/2 incles 
apart.
5. Connect the rods to the battery in a motor vehicle with the insulated 
wire.
6. Submerge 4-1/2 inches of the rods in the salt water solution.
7. With gear in neutral position, start the vehicle engine. Depress the 
accelerator approx. 1/5 of its full travel.
8. Run the engine with the accelerator in this position for 2 hours, then 
shut it down for 2 hours.
9. Repeat this cycle for a total of 64 hours while maintaining the level 
of the acid-salt water solution in the glass jar.
    * **CAUTION**: This arrangement employs voltages which can be quite dangerous! Do not touch bare wire leads while engine is running!!
10. Shut off the engine. Remove the rods from the glass jar and 
disconnect wire leads from the battery.
11. Filter the solution through the heavy cloth into a flat pan or tray, 
leaving the sediment at the bottom of the glass jar.
12. Allow the water in the filtered solution to evaporate at room 
temperature (approx. 16 hours). The residue is approximately 60% or more 
sodium chlorate which is pure enough to be used as an explosive 
ingredient.

## Implementations

### Sodium Chlorate Gunpowder

65% sodium chlorate, 22% charcoal, 13% sulfur, sprinkle some graphite on top.

### Rocket Fuel
6 parts sodium chlorate mixed *THOROUGHLY* with 5 parts rubber cement.

### Rocket Fuel 2 (better performance)

50% sodium chlorate, 35% rubber cement ('One-Coat' brand),
10% epoxy resin hardener, 5% sulfur

You may want to add more sodium chlorate depending on the purity you are using.

### Incendiary Mixture

55% aluminum powder (atomized), 45% sodium chlorate, 5% sulfur

### Impact Mixture

50% red phosphorus, 50% sodium chlorate

Unlike potassium chlorate,sodium chlorate won't explode spontaneously when
mix- ed with phosphorus.  It has to be hit to be detonated.

### Filler explosive

85% sodium chlorate, 10% vaseline, 5% aluminum powder
